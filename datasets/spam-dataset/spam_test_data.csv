 followups to spambayes URL please unless you re specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for URL ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etc exim eximNUMBER conf and etc exim local_scan py on URL i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment s notice for the record here s how it all works eximNUMBER conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etc exim harvest does not exist that is any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in eximNUMBER conf the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan py this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command no message id header and NUMBER bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headers body are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etc exim harvest are don t check for NUMBER bit chars in from header the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin do header sender verification ie ensure that there s a verifiable email address in at least one of from reply to and sender as late as possible because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns lookups timeout if etc exim harvest exists then the behaviour of all of those acls in eximNUMBER conf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages they add an x reject header to the message this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus those messages will now be seen by local_scan py which now looks for the x reject header if found it uses the folder name specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in x reject currently x reject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with x reject then local_scan py runs the usual virus and spam checks namely my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables and a run through spamassassin the logic is basically this if virus folder virus else run through spamassassin if score NUMBER NUMBER folder rejected spam elif score NUMBER NUMBER folder caught spam finally local_scan py writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted the server handles NUMBER NUMBER incoming messages per day of which maybe NUMBER NUMBER are junk mail oops just realized i haven t written the code that actually saves the message d ohh also haven t written anything to discriminate personal email which i must do sigh finally the big catch waiting until after you ve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers don t consider a NUMBERxx after data as a permanent error but keep retrying d ohh this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time but in harvest mode everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time so i have cooked up something called the asbl or automated sender blacklist this is just a berkeley db file that maps sender_ip sender_address to an expiry time when local_scan rejects a message from sender_ip sender_address for whatever reason including finding an x reject header added by an acl in eximNUMBER conf it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry time NUMBER hours in the future meanwhile there s an acl in eximNUMBER conf that checks for records in the asbl if there s a record for the current sender_ip sender_address that hasn t expired yet we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the point of view of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming URL one smtp connection per address we will most likely only get one copy this is a win if you re just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth but i m not sure if it s helpful for training spam detectors tim happy harvesting greg greg ward gward python net URL budget s in the red let s tax religion dead kennedys ,0

computer viruses authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden

rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly NUMBER participating nations only albania has formally adopted URL or ratified the treaty michael geist URL a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in e commerce law says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification they ve given for all the

authority make that case geist added that there s nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i don t know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data retention orders the united states has a similar requirement called the communications assistance for law enforcement act URL but it applies only to pre internet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews an analyst at the electronic privacy information center URL epic who specializes in international law says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes URL the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information the draft says gus hosein a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if you re allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or

 foreword after thirty three years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young african american men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young african americans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young african american culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows we are a group of people born between NUMBER and NUMBER we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations it s that simple it seems we have come to be called xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse we are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one our mothers they also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identity there are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggs s documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for b e t black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior regarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been it s funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent african american perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all african americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class african americans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what i m attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary don t feel bad there were several times i had to as well regarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of african american culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy in my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in u s penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most african americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called i m still fly shown in heavy rotation on b e t and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty its signature verse asserts i got gator boots with a pimped out gucci suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s o k cause i m still fly worse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on b e t is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and patty cake patty cake i m the bakers man i bake them cakes as fast as i can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and i disguise it as rap so the feds backup in this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references i ve identified have become an integral part of the urban african american existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the african american community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to african americans in four different ways the first being african americans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one african american man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy in the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every african american woman s fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and

i agree with rob i think if the phones and mms is building traction in europe in handsets this might be interesting bottom line is will it a help sell phones and b bill enough time on the wcarriers

it expands the market and forms a new category the extent of the category size is the big question will it be a fad or will it a sustained market that s consumer behavior and marketing but i don t

innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eye s which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesn t mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time w images than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to

cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day i d have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i don t buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about NUMBER hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just don t understand kids today and they ll run with this i wasn t saying that mms wouldn t take off because it wasn t high quality or that it wasn t easy i was saying that i couldn t see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications i m looking for the compelling reason even if it s a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i don t see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone s email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i don t think NUMBER hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots that s one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part i m guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers i m not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them that s why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but it s just nice on occasion i still can t see how it becomes a integral messaging method what s the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if it s silly if people are going to flock to it i m searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea i ve heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor s assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are then mms is never going to catch on ,0
 URL the new yorker the next world order by nicholas lemann the bush administration may have a brand new doctrine of power issue of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER posted NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER when there is a change of command and not just in government the new people often persuade themselves that the old people were much worse than anyone suspected this feeling seems especially intense in the bush administration perhaps because bill clinton has been bracketed by a father son team it s easy for people in the administration to believe that after an unfortunate eight year interlude the bush family has resumed its governance and about time too the bush administration s sense that the clinton years were a waste or worse is strongest in the realms of foreign policy and military affairs republicans tend to regard democrats as untrustworthy in defense and foreign policy anyway in ways that coincide with what people think of as clinton s weak points an eagerness to please a lack of discipline condoleezza rice bush s national security adviser wrote an article in foreign affairs two years ago in which she contemptuously accused clinton of an extraordinary neglect of the fiduciary responsibilities of the commander in chief most of the top figures in foreign affairs in this administration also served under the president s father they took office last year after what they regard as eight years of small time flyswatting by clinton thinking that they were picking up where they d left off not long ago i had lunch with sorry a senior administration foreign policy official at a restaurant in washington called the oval room early in the lunch he handed me a twenty seven page report whose cover bore the seal of the department of defense an outline map of the world and these words defense strategy for the NUMBERs the regional defense strategy secretary of defense dick cheney january NUMBER one of the difficulties of working at the highest level of government is communicating its drama actors professional athletes and even elected politicians train for years go through a great winnowing and then perform publicly people who have titles like deputy assistant secretary of defense are just as ambitious and competitive have worked just as long and hard and are often playing for even higher stakes but what they do all day is go to meetings and write memos and prepare briefings how possibly to explain that some of the documents including the report that the senior official handed me which was physically indistinguishable from a high school term paper represent the government version of playing carnegie hall after the fall of the berlin wall dick cheney then the secretary of defense set up a shop as they say to think about american foreign policy after the cold war at the grand strategic level the project whose existence was kept quiet included people who are now back in the game at a higher level among them paul wolfowitz the deputy secretary of defense lewis libby cheney s chief of staff and eric edelman a senior foreign policy adviser to cheney generally speaking a cohesive group of conservatives who regard themselves as bigger thinking tougher minded and intellectually bolder than most other people in washington donald rumsfeld the secretary of defense shares these characteristics and has been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years colin powell then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mounted a competing and presumably more ideologically moderate effort to reimagine american foreign policy and defense a date was set may NUMBER NUMBER on which each team would brief cheney for an hour cheney would then brief president bush after which bush would make a foreign policy address unveiling the new grand strategy everybody worked for months on the five twenty one brief with a sense that the shape of the post cold war world was at stake when wolfowitz and powell arrived at cheney s office on may NUMBERst wolfowitz went first but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour and cheney a hawk who perhaps liked what he was hearing did not call time on him powell didn t get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in the world until a couple of weeks later cheney briefed president bush using material mostly from wolfowitz and bush prepared his major foreign policy address but he delivered it on august NUMBER NUMBER the day that iraq invaded kuwait so nobody noticed the team kept working in NUMBER the times got its hands on a version of the material and published a front page story saying that the pentagon envisioned a future in which the united states could and should prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power a few weeks of controversy ensued about the bush administration s hawks being unilateral controversy that cheney s people put an end to with denials and the counter leak of an edited softer version of the same material as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton the cheney team s efforts took on the quality of a parting shot the report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before clinton took office it is a somewhat bland opaque document a scrubbed meaning unclassified version of something more candid but it contained the essential ideas of shaping rather than reacting to the rest of the world and of preventing the rise of other superpowers its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships a more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled from containment to global leadership which zalmay khalilzad who joined cheney s team in NUMBER and is now special envoy to afghanistan published a couple of years into the clinton administration when he was out of government it recommends that the united states preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future khalilzad writes it is a vital u s interest to preclude such a development i e to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose when george w bush was campaigning for president he and the people around him didn t seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift along the lines of the policy of containment of the soviet union s sphere of influence which the united states maintained during the cold war in his first major foreign policy speech delivered in november of NUMBER bush declared that a president must be a clear eyed realist a formulation that seems to connote an absence of world remaking ambition realism is exactly the foreign policy doctrine that cheney s pentagon team rejected partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country s ever dominating world affairs for any length of time one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of september NUMBERth have changed official foreign policy thinking any chief executive of either party would probably have done what bush has done so far made war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic security it is only now six months after the attacks that we are truly entering the realm of presidential choice and all indications are that bush is going to use september NUMBERth as the occasion to launch a new aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism all his rhetoric especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress since september NUMBERth and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked indicate that he sees this as the nation s moment of destiny a perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging because it enhances bush s stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking inside government the reason september NUMBERth appears to have been a transformative moment as the senior official i had lunch with put it is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american public s usual resistance to american military involvement overseas at least for a while the clinton administration beginning with the black hawk down operation in mogadishu during its first year operated on the conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties the all bombing kosovo operation in clinton s next to last year was the ideal foreign military adventure now that the united states has been attacked the options are much broader the senior official approvingly mentioned a NUMBER study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies which argued that the mass public is much less casualty averse than the military or the civilian élite believes for example the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction the american death total in the vietnam war was about fifty eight thousand september NUMBERth presumably reduced casualty aversion even further recently i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice rice s foreign affairs article from NUMBER begins with this declaration the united states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its national interest in the absence of soviet power i asked her whether that is still the case i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role she said immediately i think september NUMBERth was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen events are in much sharper relief like bush she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible states now define the national interest the latter goal by the way is new in bush s speech to congress on september NUMBERth america s sole grand purpose was ending terrorism we talked in her west wing office its tall windows face the part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their standups in her bearing rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public she looked a little tired but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm rather than belligerence in the foreign affairs article rice came across as a classic realist putting forth the notions of power politics great powers and power balances as the proper central concerns of the united states now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the one power idea that cheney s pentagon team proposed ten years ago or at least to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the united states because of the terrorist attacks and can be induced to remain so theoretically the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it rice said and i think what you re seeing is that there s at least a predilection this time to move to productive and coöperative relations with the united states rather than to try to balance the united states i actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out it s not all foreordained rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the national security council and asked them to think seriously about how do you capitalize on these opportunities to fundamentally change american doctrine and the shape of the world in the wake of september NUMBERth i really think this period is analogous to NUMBER to NUMBER she said that is the period when the containment doctrine took shape in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat and that it s a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition that has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics and it s important to try to seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again the national security council is legally required to produce an annual document called the national security strategy stating the over all goals of american policy another government report whose importance is great but not obvious the bush administration did not produce one last year as the clinton administration did not in its first year rice said that she is working on the report now there are two ways to handle this document she told me one is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out but it s our view that since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration it s important an awful lot has happened since we started this process prior to NUMBER NUMBER i can t give you a certain date when it s going to be out but i would think sometime this spring and it s important that it be a real statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction that it s going it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago some questions that don t appear to be settled yet but are obviously being asked are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countries and to what end and with what means the leak a couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture adding offensive capability against rogue states departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on is the united states now in a position to be redrawing regional maps especially in the middle east and replacing governments by force nobody thought that the bush administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms but plainly it is and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago just before the NUMBER election a republican foreign policy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a bush administration s direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higher ranking job paul wolfowitz or richard haass haass is another veteran of the first bush administration and an intellectual like wolfowitz but much more moderate in NUMBER he published a book titled the reluctant sheriff in which he poked a little fun at wolfowitz s famous strategy briefing of the early nineties he called it the pentagon paper and disagreed with its idea that the united states should try to be the world s only great power over the long term for better or worse such a goal is beyond our reach haass wrote it simply is not doable elsewhere in the book he disagreed with another of the wolfowitz team s main ideas that of the united states expanding the democratic zone of peace primacy is not to be confused with hegemony the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic haass argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world not more and suggested a revival of what might be called traditional great power politics wolfowitz got a higher ranking job than haass he is deputy secretary of defense and haass is director of policy planning for the state department in effect colin powell s big think guy recently i went to see him in his office at the state department on the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policy planning staff beginning with george kennan the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that haass now occupies it s another indication of the way things are moving in washington that haass seems to have become more hawkish i mentioned the title of his book using the word reluctant was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make he said it was written when bill clinton was saying it s the economy stupid not it s the world stupid two things are very different now one the president has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters second at the top of the national security charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as kennan s containment i think there is he said what you re seeing from this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideas i m not sure it constitutes a doctrine about what you might call the limits of sovereignty sovereignty entails obligations one is not to massacre your own people another is not to support terrorism in any way if a government fails to meet these obligations then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty including the right to be left alone inside your own territory other governments including the united states gain the right to intervene in the case of terrorism this can even lead to a right of preventive or peremptory self defense you essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it s a question of when and not if you re going to be attacked clearly haass was thinking of iraq i don t think the american public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein he said also i d fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the case public opinion can be changed we d be able to make the case that this isn t a discretionary action but one done in self defense on the larger issue of the american role in the world haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks he had made a speech not long before called imperial america but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist i just think that we have to be a little bit careful he said great as our advantages are there are still limits we have to have allies we can t impose our ideas on everyone we don t want to be fighting wars alone so we need others to join us american leadership yes but not american unilateralism it has to be multilateral we can t win the war against terror alone we can t send forces everywhere it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor he stopped for a moment is there a successor idea to containment i think there is he said it is the idea of integration the goal of u s foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction support for free trade democracy markets integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more the first but by no means the last obvious manifestation of a new american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein what the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf what s been done so far in afghanistan both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath several weeks ago ahmad chalabi the head of the iraqi national congress the iraqi opposition party came through washington with an entourage of his aides chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask evidently successfully for more american funding his main public event was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute chalabi s leading supporter in town richard perle the prominent hawk and former defense department official acted as moderator smiling and supremely confident perle opened the discussion by saying evidence is mounting that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with saddam hussein the war on terrorism he said will not be complete until saddam is successfully dealt with and that means replacing his regime that action will be taken i have no doubt chalabi who lives in london is a charming suave middle aged man with a twinkle in his eye he was dressed in a double breasted pin striped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar although he and his supporters argue that the iraqi national congress with sufficient american support can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the taliban in afghanistan this view hasn t won over most people in washington it isn t just that chalabi doesn t look the part of a rebel military leader he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the savoy but that s about it one skeptical former pentagon official told me or that he isn t in iraq it s also that saddam s military is perhaps ten times the size that the taliban s was and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade the united states left iraq in NUMBER believing that saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion chalabi s supporters believe that saddam is much weaker now and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off but non true believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground troops kenneth pollack a former c i a analyst who was the national security council s staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton administration recently caused a stir in the foreign policy world by publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two co authors published an article also in foreign affairs arguing that the iraqi national congress was incapable of defeating saddam pollack still doesn t think chalabi can do the job he believes that it would require a substantial american ground air and sea force closer in size to the one we used in kuwait in NUMBER NUMBER than to the one we are using now in afghanistan pollack who is trim quick and crisp is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day when i went to see him at his office in washington with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall where three maps of the middle east were hanging the only way to do it is a full scale invasion he said using a pen as a pointer we re talking about two grand corps two to three hundred thousand people altogether the population is here in the tigris euphrates valley he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra ideally you d have the saudis on board he pointed to the prince sultan airbase near riyadh you could make kuwait the base but it s much easier in saudi you need to take western iraq and southern iraq pointing again because otherwise they ll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil fields you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil fields so troops have to occupy them and you need troops to defend the kurds in northern iraq point point you go in as hard as you can as fast as you can he slapped his hand on the top of his desk you get the enemy to divide his forces by threatening him in two places at once his hand hit the desk again hard then you crush him smack that would be a reverberating blow the united states has already removed the government of one country afghanistan the new government is obviously shaky and american military operations there are not completed pakistan which before september NUMBERth clearly met the new test of national unacceptability it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction will also require long term attention since the country is not wholly under the control of the government as the murder of daniel pearl demonstrated and even parts of the government like the intelligence service may not be entirely under the control of the president in iraq if america invades and brings down saddam a new government must be established an enormous long term task in a country where there is no obvious plausible new leader the prospective iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations one of which russia is a nuclear superpower an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations iran turkey saudi arabia and even egypt events have forced the administration to become directly involved in the israeli palestinian conflict as it hadn t wanted to do so it s really the entire region that is in play in much the way that europe was immediately after the second world war in september bush rejected paul wolfowitz s recommendation of immediate moves against iraq that the president seems to have changed his mind is an indication in part of the bureaucratic skill of the administration s conservatives these guys are relentless one former official who is close to the high command at the state department told me resistance is futile the conservatives other weapon besides relentlessness is intellectualism colin powell tends to think case by case and since september NUMBERth the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading iraq if the united states applies the doctrines of cheney s old pentagon team shaping and expanding the zone of democracy the implications would extend far beyond that one operation the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with the administration seem to be bernard lewis of princeton and fouad ajami of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies both of whom see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation lewis was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior foreign policy staff one point he made is look in that part of the world nothing matters more than resolute will and force the senior official i had lunch with told me in other words the united states needn t proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the arab street as long as it is prepared to be strong the senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the middle east charles hill of yale who in a recent essay declared every regime of the arab islamic world has proved a failure and reuel marc gerecht of the american enterprise institute who published an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in iran and syria those goals gerecht told me when we spoke could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion several people i spoke with predicted that most or even all of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to finish the job one purpose of vice president cheney s recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation in any event the administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world s approval when i spoke to condoleezza rice she said that the united states should assemble coalitions of the willing to support its actions rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations an invasion of iraq would test that policy in more ways than one the administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the iraq operation when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year it asked for a forty eight billion dollar increase in defense spending for fiscal NUMBER which begins in october NUMBER much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism that s probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of iraq this spring the administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion trying to secure basing and overflight privileges while bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction a drama involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer and will end with the united states declaring that the terms that saddam offers for the inspections involving delays and restrictions are unacceptable then probably in the late summer or early fall the enormous troop positioning which will take months will begin the administration obviously feels confident that the united states can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop buildup and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the republican guard the military key to the country to turn against saddam and topple him on its own but the chain of events leading inexorably to a full scale american invasion if it hasn t already begun evidently will begin soon lewis scooter libby who was the principal drafter of cheney s future of the world documents during the first bush administration now works in an office in the old executive office building overlooking the west wing where he has a second smaller office a packet of public relations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his NUMBER novel the apprentice quotes the times calling him dick cheney s dick cheney which seems like an apt description he appears absolutely sure of himself and whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss speaks in a tough confidential gravelly rumble like condoleezza rice and bush himself he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right the only truly prudent course when i went to see libby not long ago i asked him whether before september NUMBERth american policy toward terrorism should have been different he went to his desk and got out a large black loose leaf binder filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle east he looked through it for a long minute formulating his answer let us stack it up he said at last somalia NUMBER NUMBER the discovery of the al qaeda related plot in the philippines NUMBER the world trade center first bombing NUMBER the attempt to assassinate president bush former president bush and the lack of response to that the lack of a serious response to that NUMBER the riyadh bombing NUMBER the khobar bombing NUMBER the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy bombing NUMBER the plot to launch millennium attacks NUMBER the bombing of the cole throughout this period infractions on inspections by the iraqis and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime and the failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas no one would say these challenges posed easy problems but if you take that long list and you ask did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities or activities clearly against our interests did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against u s interests many observers conclude no and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise up and say credibly the americans don t have the stomach to defend themselves they won t take casualties to defend their interests they are morally weak libby insisted that the american response to september NUMBERth has not been standard or foreordained look at what the president has done in afghanistan he said and look at his speech to the joint session of congress meaning the state of the union message in january he made it clear that it s an important area he made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests and he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part take the afghan case for example there are many other courses that the president could have taken he could have waited for juridical proof before we responded he could have engaged in long negotiations with the taliban he could have failed to seek a new relationship with pakistan based on its past nuclear tests or been so afraid of weakening pakistan that we didn t seek its help this list could go on to twice or three times the length i ve mentioned so far but instead the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests the problem is complex and we don t know yet how it will end but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with afghanistan as important as it was as a threat but with the states of central asia pakistan russia and as it may develop with the states of southwest asia more generally we moved on to iraq and the question of what makes saddam hussein unacceptable in the administration s eyes the issue is not inspections libby said the issue is the iraqis promise not to have weapons of mass destruction their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait their promise not to threaten other countries and other promises that they made in NUMBER and a number of u n resolutions including all the other problems i listed whether it was wise or not and that is the subject of debate iraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms it failed to take that chance then and annually for the next ten years what s your level of confidence i asked him that the current regime will in fact change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately there is no basis in iraq s past behavior to have confidence in good faith efforts on their part to change their behavior r a hettinga

i attended the same conference and was impressed by a few systems that jim didn t mention in terms of cms the following all had apparently been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some pretty strong competition to commercial systems midgard URL a php based content management framework that with other programs combines to be a full cms redhat ccm cms java based URL opencms java based URL there was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source strength but both plone and xopus represented some real movement towards improving that situation i was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on xml some took for granted that xslt was relevant to content management others took it just as for granted that xslt was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore xml almost completely i attended realizing that content management is generally used to apply to web content management but i was still a bit shocked how completely out of scope document management was almost no consideration of the potential print pdf dimension to content other than the occasional and you can use fop to make pdf as if that was functional this seems more the case in open source content management than in commercial content management and probably makes xml easier to ignore if html is the be all and end all of the output the honesty was refreshing phil suh complained about the state of current tools both open source and commercial and i wish i d written down what he said something like it sucks so extremely it sucks so widely and it is so generally sucking that it seems sometimes there is no hope for a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial systems scaled so well that the commercial big boys were really much more functional than open source until someone pointed out ok take some average blog software spend NUMBER NUMBER on the rollout it ll scale pretty well another quote citing brendan quinn content management problems are either trivial or impossible mac os x is getting popular of the laptops there it was an even NUMBER NUMBER each of mac linux windows i am sure it wasn t news to jim but i can t wait to try subversion a cvs replacement that supports some of the newer features of webdav URL i m also eager to try xopus i hope the developers make it back home safely they said they d only been in america four days but were already homeless max ,0

NUMBER the people who pay the wages don t give a flyin heck what programming language you write things in they just want it to work robert harley wrote in my experience they do care it has to work certainly and in particular it has to work with what they ve already got and it has to work on client s systems my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and haven t come back yet well i think until recently support for most things on linux was kind of shady things have got much better you re right in that the jdk used to suck on linux but then imho linux is still maturing or at least development tools for linux are maturing i ve been developing a few server side apps that run on linux recently with jdk NUMBER

application platform you don t think this has anything to do with net being a competitor to java do you or that ms has basically copied java with some additional features and called it c isn t that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications reza b far wrote NUMBER c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory

telling me that you ve never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak i am not the best c c programmer not even close but i ve known really good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management however occasional they may be it s about design patterns architecture high level stuff robert harley wrote if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve then it s trivial anyway irrespective of language wow so you re telling me that unless the application involves bit counting it s trivial what about the application itself what about high level problems such as task distribution work flow etc aren t most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal c c code for example do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks there are lots of them on this list are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved NUMBER million times over and over and over again robert harley wrote you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant low level problems and java programmers don t depends entirely on the programmer not the language i can see how you could infer this however what i believe to really be the case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers in those cases it s always very hard to get the programmers to agree on api s memory management techniques etc with java the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you don t sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database jdbc or a messaging bus jms NUMBER java is not just a programming language it s also a platform robert harley wrote buzzword yikes have you written db code with c c for different databases just an example tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix say you have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql bad idea but for the sake of the example would you rather deal with jdbc port or c c port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use odbc a monolithic set of api s or a crap load of different api s slicing and dicing the same problems NUMBER different ways robert harley wrote unsupported assertion so are you saying that there is a standard set of api s for c c for everything aside to the minimal ansi stuff is there a standard way of dealing with c c applications for various domain problems messaging database persistence etc that rivals java i d like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes c c in that case i claim ignorance not suggesting that java is the golden hammer just that c c is overkill for most things i even coded in vb but vb is a true disgrace to programming it s just lame java is object oriented no flame mail from the anti oo people please that is a religious discussion and relatively clean and i don t think that every kid can write a well designed java program kids typically don t understand various design patterns and principles to my experience they actually tend to think more of the low level problems wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world a tendency that is much more possible imho in c c than in java due to existence of standard api s ,0

 if the text recognition algorithm architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm structure we ve been working with the reason the first letter and to a lesser extent the last letter is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult from a theoretical standpoint anyway and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis the middle letters are far less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly i think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages maybe even japanese romongi bill ,0

 URL september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER a m the wages of september NUMBER there is no going back september NUMBER changed our world those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially short term view and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets this is a colossal misjudgment the collapse of the towers the crashing into the pentagon and the murder of NUMBER NUMBER americans all seen live in real time by millions the world over tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds which if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades the killers dealt in icons the choice of NUMBER as the date of death targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world yes they got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally repugnant and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after NUMBER NUMBER they prove only ghoulish not fearsome the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden the more it has found them both vile and yet banal and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for it is one thing to kill innocents quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come NUMBER NUMBER miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september NUMBER will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the taliban the iranian mullocracy the plague of the pakistani madrassas and any other would be fundamentalist paradise on earth foreign relations will not be the same in our generation our coalition with europe we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euro american globetrotters a paper alliance without a mission nearly NUMBER years after the end of the cold war the truth is that europe out of noble purposes for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu a NUMBER NUMBER person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords this sad realization september NUMBER brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american ankle biting even as europe lives in a make believe shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september NUMBER america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september NUMBER being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases like nato belongs to a pre NUMBER NUMBER age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting state sponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles and as likely to come from friends as enemies worst case scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more long term hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us and vice versa the saudi royal family whom NUMBER NUMBER american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed the post NUMBER NUMBER domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnam era invective i think rings hollow after september NUMBER and sounds more like mcclellan s shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton s audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly NUMBER years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in high rises politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a value neutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september NUMBER and the subsequent terrible year and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead ,0

if it s not stateful it wouldn t seem to be worth the effort although i guess it might help with ddos attacks sounds snake oilish to me but i m biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy

in silicon no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first NUMBER bytes of a packet while the xaNUMBER provides deeper packet inspection looking at NUMBER NUMBER bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the NUMBERu high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xaNUMBER can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup

agree at least in part but i m sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring iq purity of heart or the ability to satisfy customers functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list or even just being a garden variety millionaire next door is more likely to be the serving customers definition differences due to merit when they are perceived as such generate

suggesting to me that they weren t exactly poor to start with actually if i remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in forbes about five or six years ago the best way to get on the forbes NUMBER is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the forbes NUMBER as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this summer that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out there including me to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes NUMBER list is someone with a terminal professional degree like an mba phd md etc from the best school possible why because as of about NUMBER the best way to get into harvard for instance is to be smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof meritocracy american style was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of course chicago taught them all how right practically nobody who goes to a top NUMBER american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last NUMBER years or so and their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes NUMBER would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some

 URL hamza s horrid but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER the guardian sheikh abu hamza al masri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park hackney i ve often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by b q on the way home i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea an ice cream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you too but b q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza s budget since the bank of england froze his assets so victoria park had to do but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful islamic proto warriors in the background you must know hamza he s the imam designed it would seem by the daily mail s cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eye covered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milky white we don t mock the disabled any more these days unless it s someone like hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come off so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right as captain hook in articles which usually call for his arrest or extradition to the us or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities anywhere really just out of here and if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him to shut up because we don t like hamza very much we weren t that fond of him before september NUMBER but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political persecution and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out of context and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered but perhaps he should be because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror s scoop hamza preaches or preached at the scary finsbury park mosque so earlier this year the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks i didn t know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen he is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press and this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be true hamza is not representative of british muslims as if british muslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succour the trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those government approved muslim spokesmen who were uncomfortably i suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban an opinion poll commissioned by radio NUMBER s today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush s crusade one in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the us the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam which is what hamza said repeatedly but it was something that at the time we didn t want to hear now if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across superficially at least as someone from the liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth nor is he particularly anti semitic so far as i can tell although i don t suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterday s guardian the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy in a truly islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for example you and i would find many perhaps most of his views utterly repellent and that s the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism multiculturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from them the fbi has been investigating hamza but of course has found nothing remotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally this is a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash you don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist and if british muslims maybe a minority maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the man up therefore won t make a difference it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by

definitional nit to pick robert harley writes it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly precisely identical between males and females of course the shapes of the distributions may differ you ve redefined promiscuity above as total or average activity which seems to rob it of its common meaning activity above some specific threshold usually one or norm or involving extra or indiscriminate variety promiscuity is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages consider a population of NUMBER males and NUMBER females let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once then let one of the males also have sex with the other two females sure the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes tautologically but here more women than men are above the single partner threshold above the overall average NUMBER NUMBER acts partners threshold above the overall median NUMBER NUMBER acts partners above the overall mode NUMBER acts partners and here women have a higher mode NUMBER and median NUMBER number of partners so in this contrived population females are more promiscuous than males unless promiscuity is defined uselessly gordon ,0

one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the fire fighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire fighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren t on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live work within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time fire fighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives NUMBER miles from his station so how he ll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery and i can t see many fire fighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations dave to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0

blogstart dublin something from the archives daev walsh forwards an article from the irish digest about billy in the bowl this story is also immortalised in an old dublin song which in turn was mentioned in a pogues track billy was a legless beggar in the alleys of stoneybatter and grangegorman where i now live during the NUMBERth century who discovered a new but not entirely legal way to make money blogend linktext billy in the bowl from daev hellshaw URL subject the case of the stoneybatter strangler a story of my new neighbourhood the irish digest july NUMBER the case of the stoneybatter strangler the handsome deformed billy in the bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors then one night he made the biggest mistake of his life dublin in the eighteenth century was noted for two things the architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes many of these beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin but there was one who campaigned among the working class this was billy in the bowl the strange appellation was derived from the fact that billy s sole means of transport was a large bowl shaped car with wheels seated in this bowl the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground with wooden plugs one in each hand billy s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary as he had been born without legs nature however had compensated for this by endowing him with powerful arms and shoulders and what was most important an unusually handsome face this was billy s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating sympathetic passers by from their small change the cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century grangegorman and stoneybatter until a servant girl or an old lady would come along he would then put on is most attractive smile which together with his black curly hair never failed to halt the females the fact that such a handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity billy in the bowl however wasn t satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices gambling and drinking as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk was falling the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street on dublin s north quays when billy heard the woman s footsteps he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane as his unsuspecting victim drew close the beggar moaned and shouted and cried out for help trembling with excitement the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes in a few minutes it was all over the woman lay in a dead faint and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his bowl his victirn s purse snug in his coat pocket an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition but failed to give a description of her assailant and as billy in the bowl had figured nobody would suspect a deformed beggar again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter on one occasion billy in the bowl tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her the incident became known as the NUMBER grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir hundred s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months billy in the bowl was forced to desert his usual haunts around this period dublin s first ever police force was been mobilised and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder months passed and billy in the bowl reverted once again to his old pasttime a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district but the beggar still rolled along in his bowl pitied and unsuspected then came the night that finished billy s career of crime two stoudy built female cooks trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help rushing over they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch billy thinking there was only one woman grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch she proved much too strong for him however and while resisting tore at his face with her sharp finger nails meanwhile her companion acted with speed and daring pulling out her large hatpin she made for the beggar and plunged the pin into his right eye the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy billy in the bowl was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl the grangegorman stoneybatter district became once again a quiet attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night daev _______________________________ rev dave daev walsh daev URL home URL weekly rant URL is it about a

url URL date not supplied we re trying to decide if fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER should support custom fields historically i am opposed to custom fields in principle because they get abused people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard end result people don t enter bugs which is much much worse than not capturing all that information you can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine this is an actual customer request information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs why not just have the programmer assignee look at the bug first and if they think it might be dll version related only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info similarly it s always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred this sounds logical but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant but then how do you search for say all bugs which only happen on windows NUMBERse aha you can t ever even with the custom field because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system so this search doesn t make sense in the first place the info wasn t captured do a full text search for NUMBERse and you ll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while you re at it a photograph of the tester s workspace but the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_ which all else being equal takes priority over making it easy to find them i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system because they didn t know what all those fields were the _real_ bug tracking happened in email post its and hallway conversations great a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is does fogbugz support custom fields rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks i ve been saying can you please tell me what fields you would need we re trying to decide whether to implement that feature in NUMBER NUMBER and we want to know why people need it the interesting thing is almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in fogbugz _ and the other ones in my educated opinion shouldn t be fields and in fact our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design but i didn t and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product gosh even filemaker has custom fields righto it s true and who am i to tell my customers they are wrong one person who i was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built in field for this would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved but it s still rude of me to tell customers that we don t have that feature _for their own good_ even though it usually is and we re losing some sales because of it sigh i guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don t use it at least we won t lose any sales NUMBER URL ,0

hi kragen this is an interesting analysis i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick for example i don t expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while i think that the most important issue which is that end users won t be able to fix their systems is almost passed over i know that you know this and you allude to it but your essay is getting passed around so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others there s one other point which you don t make which i think is very important which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can t happen without libraries of available vulnerability code i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped uninvited about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples in the open that you can define a set and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure we wouldn t have stackguard itsNUMBER nissus or snort and the security admin s job would be a lot harder

thu NUMBER aug NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER edt from kragen sitaker kragen pobox com to fork URL subject the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards on august NUMBERth an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late NUMBERs which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldn t apply them because they didn t know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlett packard to keep a vulnerability in hp s truNUMBER unix secret if hp retained snosoft s consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret i ve heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i don t think that s plausible if someone can steal NUMBER NUMBER because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software aren t liable either when credit card data are stolen from an e commerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web site administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remote root hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime let s not let that happen this is the original idefense announcement from sunil james mailto sjames URL sent wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm subject introducing idefense s vulnerability contributor program greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the work the compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared i e vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i contribute the vcp is active you are welcome to begin

glaciers a bounty of a warming world by alex markels as he hiked near colorado s continental divide in the summer of NUMBER ed knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at NUMBER NUMBER feet it looked like a bison skull the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls i thought that s strange bison don t live this high up knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bison one that died about NUMBER years ago this was an extraordinary discovery says russ graham the museum s chief curator adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago there s probably a lot more like it yet to be found and not just bison colorado isn t the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaska a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industry have shrunk or thawed many of the world s NUMBER NUMBER glaciers as the ice recedes a treasure trove of human and animal artifacts is emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze the fabrics wood bone and dna rich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued it s mind boggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains says johan reinhard a high altitude archaeologist and explorer in residence at the national geographic society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the NUMBERs and the legendary NUMBER NUMBER year old ice man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in NUMBER have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother nature and looters take them first once uncovered frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover they re often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don t even realize they re ancient that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a zip loc bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter s body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about NUMBER years ago dubbed kwaday dan ts inchi or long ago person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the best preserved human from the period ever found in north america other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that long ago person was doing in the mountains in the first place before this there was no archaeological record of people living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we see that this area was very much part of people s seasonal activities like ward s discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at NUMBER NUMBER feet in the mountains of the south yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadn t been caribou in the area for at least NUMBER years recalls kuzyk then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a NUMBER NUMBER year old atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the ice patch and scores of others around the region revealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling NUMBER NUMBER years of changing hunting practices scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies hunters followed the game they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice we ve got people hunting with throwing darts up until NUMBER NUMBER years ago says hare who now oversees the research project then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about NUMBER NUMBER years ago and by NUMBER NUMBER years ago there s no more throwing darts now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska s wrangell and st elias mountain ranges the united states most glaciated terrain and in the andes johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings perhaps as exquisite as the ice man global warming is providing us high altitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now we re probably about the only ones happy about
