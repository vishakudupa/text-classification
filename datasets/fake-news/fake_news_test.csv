today we are going to take a quick look at two epic clint eastwood films one of which is a wellknown western classic  the outlaw josey wales  the other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female  play misty for me  
both of these superb rpo films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old uncle bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap yes indeed 
so lets get crackin  the outlaw josey wales   clint eastwood chief dan george bill mckinney john vernon 
clint eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postcivil war epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent but eastwoods portrayal of the southernsympathizer josey wales who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement 
out for blood and taking no prisoners eastwoods merciless josey wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary but wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change 
theres a great scene early on in the film involving josey wales partner in crime jaimie played by sam bottoms where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales head 
here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor len lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on eastwoods alphamale killingmachine 
if youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate yup you know the routine 
in the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon sondra locke see above photo locke portrays kansasborn settler laura lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos e   etcclints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen she was giving her consent  didnt you see it  it was in her eyes  its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  murderer creeper pussyblocker  
unfortunately just like today there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mids and after more than  years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey uncle bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah ill get back to the film review now 
my favorite scene in the movie occurs when josey wales who now that i think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a native american woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers 
eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself i mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic western film 
maybe im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it so this might have been a sly hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but i dont really want to think that way about clint so i wont ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better 
i mean clint played dirty harry callahan for chrissakes in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if i dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting  arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media ceo or a billionaire 
the film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category if you havent seen it rectify that soon you cant miss by watching this topdrawer rpo film for men  play misty for me   clint eastwood jessica walter donna mills 
unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in hollywood any longer 
when you think of clint eastwood you usually think of dirty harry  or the outlaw josey wales  or unforgiven  or gran torino but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders 
in this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller carmelbythesea disk jockey dave carver clint eastwood lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeersjw moment there sorry 
that is until jessica walters psychostalker character evelyn walks into his life 
now you may have encountered a few of these yourself or maybe its just me sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims if youre hot and insaneim your guy but clint eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walters batshitcrazy evelyn 
ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves but i could be wrong about that i was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me be that as it may jessica walters really brings her agame in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn if youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery 
have you ever done thiswhat clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so i definitely feel your pain and ill bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film 
play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all i wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female and for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent rpo film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying 
by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots 
always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on dvd and if you smell an sjw rat dont spend your money its that simple in the end its just like investigating a potential ltr candidate you have to conduct your due diligence otherwise you might just get taken for a ride",1
"feds warn nyc officials about possible al qaeda attack  
new york post 
new york city law enforcement authorities are on high alert after receiving a warning by the feds about a possible attack by al qaeda on the eve of election day sources said 
us intelligence officials alerted joint terrorism task forces of the threat which also included texas and virginia  though specific sites targeted for monday in the three states were not mentioned a federal source told the post 
mayor bill de blasio said friday he had learned of the threat several days ago during classified briefings 
we are still very much assessing the credibility it is not at all clear how credible this is de blasio told wnycs brian lehrer on his weekly radio show were certainly in a vigilant position 
hizzoner said the nypd is planning an extraordinary police presence for tuesday when americans go to the polls 
for the first time in memory there will be two presidential campaigns having their victory celebrations in new york city on tuesday night he said quickly correcting himself that only one candidate will be celebrating 
donald trump the republican nominee will be at the new york hilton midtown on sixth avenue while hillary clinton his democratic counterpart will be at the javits convention center across town on th avenue 
police also will be heavily deployed for the new york city marathon on sunday de blasio said 
meanwhile gov andrew cuomo declined to confirm the threat friday but also noted the high state of alert for election day 
we have more state police more national guard more soldiers on duty than ever before he said so the bad news is new york is often a threat the good news is weve been dealing with this now for over a decade and we have prepared for it 
the nypd and the port authority of new york and new jersey said they had been alerted to the possible attacks 
we are aware of the information we have been working with the fbi through the joint terrorism task force and our counterterrorism and intelligence bureaus the nypd said in a statement 
we continue to encourage anyone with any information that could be relevant to the safety of our city to contact law enforcement the department said 
the port authority  which operates airports tunnels and bridges in and around the big apple  said it too was prepared 
we are continuing the high level of security we have had in place at all of our facilities for many months spokesman steve coleman told the post 
the fbi did not comment specifically about the threat against the three states but said counterterrorism and homeland security authorities remain vigilant and wellpostured to handle attacks 
the fbi working with our federal state and local counterparts shares and assesses intelligence on a daily basis and will continue to work closely with law enforcement and intelligence community partners to identify and disrupt any potential threat to public safety an fbi official said 
fridays threat followed a report by nbc news that the us government believes hackers from russia or other countries may try to unleash cyberattacks to wreak havoc ahead of election day 
an effort coordinated by the white house and the department of homeland security  and including the cia the national security agency and other elements of the department of defense  is being conducted to avert attacks nbc news reported",0
"isaac davis 
the months long dakota access keystone xl pipleine protest at the standing rock indian reservation by native americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply have been met with a heavyhanded and brutal clamp down by police and national guard militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with lrad sonic weapons attack dogs  tear gas tazers  and even live ammunition  killing horses  while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up 
but as the saying goes water is life  and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement therefore for people concerned with life giving up on this is simply unthinkable the root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism and the perception that money is more important than life itself when the police and national guard attack us citizens on private property to protect corporate interests who are they really working for 
the corporate dream of the keystone xl pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way at the top of this pyramid of profit is texas billionaire kelcy warren ceo of energy transfer partners the company responsible for the project 
so who is kelcy warren 
a native of east texas and graduate of the university of texas at arlington with a degree in civil engineering warren worked in the natural gas industry and became cochair of energy transfer equity in  with business partner ray davis coowner of the texas rangers baseball team warren built energy transfer equity into one of the nations largest pipeline companies which now owns about  miles of pipelines carrying natural gas natural gas liquids refined products and crude oil the companys holdings include sunoco southern union and regency energy partners 
forbes estimates the yearold warrens personal wealth at  billion bloomberg described him as among americas new shale tycoons  but rather than building a fortune by drilling he takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another chilling boiling pressurizing and processing it until its worth more than when it burst from the wellhead  source  
shockingly in  the governor of texas greg abbott appointed warren to the texas parks and wildlife commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect big bend national park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another  million pipeline project  
according to the governors office the state parks and wildlife commission manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of texas along with ensuring the future of hunting fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for texans  source  
this glaring conflict of interest has inspired environmental science major at utsa and former texas state park ambassador andrew lucas to begin a drive to have warren removed from this environmental post his petition is described here  
most people may know kelcy warren as the man behind the controversial dakota access pipeline the dallasbased billionaire and ceo of energy transfer partners has been making headlines for fasttracking a  mile crude oil pipeline across the midwest and under the missouri river just north of the standing rock sioux reservation no environmental impact assessment no respect for cultural sites and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river a similar story is unfolding out in west texas where warrens company has split through the pristine big bend region with the  mile comanche trail pipeline and nearlycomplete  mile trans pecos pipeline these pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the trans pecos region 
with untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of energy transfer partners it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago texas governor greg abbott appointed kelcy warren for a  year term as  of the  commissioners who preside over texas parks and wildlife why probably the  in campaign contributions abbott received from warren 
footage of militarized police using the long range acoustic device  lrad  crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on october th  final thoughts 
warren is listed as number  on forbes list of wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion in september of  he is the head of the dakota access pipeline snake 
if you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating gassing and attacking peaceful resistors  including women children and the elderly the answer is they are doing it to protect the interests of kelcy warren and others invested in this pipeline project read more articles by isaac davis

october afternoon was cooling off as evening approached and jonathan could see his breath the coach trundled past wellmaintained stone gables and a heavy wroughtiron gate standing open on one side oil lanterns hung from black hooks in the gables glowed dimly in the fog and additional lanterns spilled pools of yelloworange light on a cobblestone drive as they made their way up toward the house eleanor gasped as the massive shape of the house came into view its beautiful jonathan made a surprised hm but otherwise said nothing a welldressed footman dashed out to lower the stairs of their coach and open the door then offered a whitegloved hand to eleanor as she peered out with a flashed smile at jonathan she accepted the young mans hand and descended the driver was speaking quietly with another footman and an older man emerged from the heavy oak door of the house as jonathan descended the steps of the coach the older man  clearly the butler  bowed to eleanor and jonathan welcome to the anne union keyes estate i am mister walker and i am at your service the master of the estate has invited you in for the evening meal the butler spoke with some kind of british accent but beyond

showing on his hands however the man was tall and straightbacked and he carried himself proudly there was a stiffness to his movements and he used a cane to walk but when jonathan shook his large hands the mans grip was as firm as a man half his age welcome he said warmly and with what jonathan thought was a german accent i am gottfried hansjürgen von graeff please be welcome in my home how may i call you the mans eyes were unusual but jonathan could not place what it was about them that seemed so he shrugged it off thank you herr von graeff i am jonathan rockport this is my fiancée eleanor harrington we really have only stopped to find our way back to the highway we are trying to get to sturbridge village to stay for the night before continuing on to fall river in the morning ah

"surgeons admit that mammography is outdated and harmful to women 
friday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags breast cancer  mammography  harming women naturalnews every year millions of women flock to their doctors to get their annual mammograms a breast cancer screening procedure that involves pressing a womans breasts between two metal platforms to scope out tumors but surgeons everywhere are starting to question the controversial practice  which studies show isnt even an effective screening tool and is actually harmful to the bodies of women who receive itthe public is told that mammograms are the only way to catch breast cancer early but a review of eight scientific trials evaluating the procedure found that mammography is neither effective nor safe after looking at data on more than  women between the ages of  and  who underwent the procedure on a routine basis researchers found that many women are misdiagnosed many of these same women are consequently mistreated with chemotherapy  resulting in their rapid demiseas published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews  the review concluded that mammography causes more harm than good  because many more women end up being misdiagnosed and mistreated than those actually avoiding the development of terminal breast cancer thus the procedure known as mammography is an outdated scourge that belongs in the history books of failed medical treatments and not at the forefront of womens medicineif we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by  and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at  it means that for every  women invited for screening throughout  years one will avoid dying of breast cancer and  healthy women  who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening will be treated unnecessarily the authors concluded group of top medical experts admits mammography does more harm than good one year after this review was published a second one published in the new england journal of medicine nejm came to a similar conclusion a team of medical professionals that included a medical ethicist a clinical epidemiologist a pharmacologist an oncologic surgeon a nurse scientist a lawyer and a health economist decided that the medical industrys claims about the benefits of mammography are essentially bunkthey found that for every  women screened in the us over a year annual screening period beginning at age  one breast cancer death would be prevented while a shocking  to  women would have a false positive while  to  would undergo an unnecessary biopsy between three and  of these women the study found would also be overdiagnosed for a nonmalignant form of cancer that never even would have become clinically apparentthis study out of switzerland corroborates another out of canada  the  canadian national breast screening study  which concluded in lockstep with the others that mammography screenings do not reduce mortality rates from breast cancer any better than a simple physical examination in other words the procedure is completely unnecessary and in many cases exceptionally harmful and on and on the list goes with data out of norway and elsewhere confirming that mammography isnt all that its cracked up to be us data spanning the course of nearly  years shows that more women are over or misdiagnosed with breast cancer because of mammograms than are successfully earlydiagnosed with breast cancer in such a way as to protect against metastasization this represents an exceptionally poor track record that calls into question why mammography continues to be used when it clearly doesnt worki believe that if you did have a tumor the last thing you would want to do is crush that tumor between two plates because that would spread it says general practitioner dr sarah mybill as quoted in the documentary film the promise  sources for this article include",0
he is not going to admit he knew this needs to be investigated they lie so much neither one of them can keep this stuff straight,1
"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

"kingdoms energy minister says move would risk damaging the us economy  shares
   
saudi arabia has warned donald trump that the incoming us president will risk the health of his countrys economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports
over the course of the twoyear american election process republican nominee trump promised on the campaign trail to divest us interests from our foes and the oil cartels referring mainly to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec of which the ksa is the largest producer and de facto leader
at his heart presidentelect trump will see the benefits and i think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy khalid alfalih  chairman of aramco and saudi aramco oil minister told the financial times in marrakesh where world leaders are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark  climate change agreement
saudi arabia is the us largest middle eastern oil supplier though the north american country gets most of its energy from domestic and canadian sources
alfalih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the united states because it has created a refining industry and ignited a jobhungry shale revolution
more setting the method to probe ussaudi wars how the occupied mentality syndrome works will a  page congressional report on  unravel us foreign policy the occupied mentality syndrome the us is sort of the flagbearer for capitalism and free markets according to alfalih the us continues to be a very important part of a global industry that is interconnected that is dealing with a fungible commodity which is crude oil so having equalization through free trade is very healthy for oil
during presidential race donald trump had blamed saudi arabia for the  terrorist attacks and in march the real estate magnate said he would consider stopping us oil purchases from saudi arabia and other arab allies unless the saudi government provided ground troops to fight isis
ny daily news revealed trump sold the th floor of trump world tower to the kingdom of saudi arabia for  million in june  according to a city finance department spokeswoman in  the apartments became part of the saudi mission to the united nations records show
the reports emerged back then revealed the reality of trumps relations with the riyadh regime but mr trump has not always expressed a positive view of the middle eastern country",0

"a look at the universitys new mission october   jack kerwick 
jonathan haidt a professor of social psychology at new york university argued in a recently published essay that while its traditional telos end or goal has been truth within the last few decades the university has assumed another social justice 
the university however can only have one telos 
the conflict between these two goals has raged for decades haidt claims last year though it became unmanageable when student groups at  universities and colleges around the country issued  demands  to administrators demands for social justice that by and large were met 
the following statement is posted at blackliberationcollectiveorg  
we demand at the minimum black students and black faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of black folk in the state and the country 
we demand free intuition for black and indigenous students 
we demand a divestment from prisons and an investment in communities 
a statement of principles follows the black liberation collective blc opposes antiblackness sexism ableism capitalism white privilege inequality and heteronormativity it rejects as well nonviolence considered as a principle in contradistinction to a tactic  
antiblack racism is woven in the fabric of our global society says the blc when social systems are racialized by white supremacy whiteness becomes the default of humanity and blackness is stripped of its humanity becoming a commodity becoming disposable 
the blc is antisexist insofar as it affirms the value of all black womens lives whether cisgender transgender or genderqueer in addition to rejecting eurocentric beauty standards that are made to lessen the beauty of black women and black womens features being antisexist also means realizing that police brutality the prison industrial system school to prison pipeline and the like are aspects of structural racism that affect black women as much as they impact black men 
black liberation entails queer liberation and trans liberation we also seek to destroy the heteronormative norms that dehumanize black queer people the blc asserts the homophobia within the black community comes by way of the same hands responsible for white supremacy 
presumably transphobia within the black community is also a legacy of white supremacy in cooperation with cissexism and the gender binary transphobia has been used as a means of invalidating and erasing our trans family members the blc pledges to eliminate such systemic biases 
these social justice warriors sjws are staunch opponents of the capitalist notions of infinite profit homogenized markets and a privatized means of production capitalism they insist is the economic system thats been used to justify the oppression marginalization and exploitation of blacks 
nor is the solution to this oppression to be found in supporting blackowned businesses the blc explains that we cannot adopt the patriarchal exploitative tools of our oppressors as we seek liberation rather the solution is to dismantle antiblack capitalist corporations that benefit from our oppression 
it isnt only the capitalist corporations that these students want destroyed they demand as well the eradication of all institutional practices and policies that discriminate against the black community and the removal of all federal state and local government officials who do not abide by our principles 
the state and all its institutions that deny black humanity and black agency must be dismantled and replaced with those that produce black liberty 
concerning its attitude toward america the blc is clear this country was built to systematically oppress groups of people and the black liberation collective will not stand for it 
haidt misspeaks in characterizing  as the year when the university experienced a crisis of identity an unmanageable conflict of goals to judge from the vast majority of liberal arts humanities and social sciences departments social justice long ago eclipsed truth as the raison detre of the academy interestingly it is these sjw demands from last year that bear this out 
perhaps it is because ive spent the last couple of decades in the academy in the capacity of both student and faculty that i may be more privy to this than are some others but its painfully obvious that these student activists did not come up with these demands on their own if they didnt have their professors actually write the demands for them then the black liberation collective unquestionably derived the concepts and language of their statement of demands from their mentors 
to put it bluntly one must attend college major in the liberal arts and humanities and study under far left professors in order to think in the terms that are characteristic of social justice warriors 
leftist ideologues are training their students to bend the university to their will this is the first point there is though another a rich irony that is lost upon these selfstyled radicals 
for all of their bluster over systemic racism and structural white supremacy ie phenomena that are omnipresent and hence largely unconscious these black students their white collaborators and their professors fail to realize that their thinking for lack of a better term on these issues is about as eurocentric as one can get the  critical race theory  to which the blc subscribe is a version of marxism the philosophical vision of a  th century germanjewish man the marxist tradition within which they are enmeshed was fleshed out over a span of generations by mostly white heterosexual men 
but theres more to it than this 
the idea that racism sexism homophobia transphobia ableism and the like against which sjws rail are evils to be defeated is itself peculiar to the moral traditions of european civilization if these isms and phobias are immoral it can only be because those who are guilty of them fail to judge the individual as an individual color gender sexual orientation ability and so forth are neither constitutive of nor essential to the moral identity of the individualbut only if the framework of the doctrine of individualism is accepted 
yet this conception of the sacrosanct individual is as eurocentric as the proverbial apple pie is american 
the social justice warriors intellectual landscape is as much a european colony as was any west african country in the  th or early  th centuries those in the black liberation collective have most definitely internalized the modes of thought of their oppressor 
now they would have been well aware of all this had they received a genuine education in college rather than a training in social justice",1

" things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  
why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island 
here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
 trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side 
ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life 
 trump was named in epsteins little black book 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman 
 trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies 
mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  
epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends 
 both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl 
radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists 
 epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls 
back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir 
 at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often 
virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians 
 trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served 
in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened 
there is no debate over what happened said one of roberts attorneys i served mr trump with a subpoena for deposition in  he talked to me voluntarily and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information i cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this 
additionally garten told vice news in january that mr trump has no relationship with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trumps maralago a lot of people hung out there including jeffrey epstein said garten that is the only connection 
according to the evidence however the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that tags",1
"cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal
while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts
the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them
political naiveté nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump
this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naiveté can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naiveté can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government 
a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveé because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions 
accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles 
if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  
to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative 
lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far
lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine 
doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them 
the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings 

from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language
an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers
however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor
a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over
in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics
they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop
having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years 
unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets 
accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics 
this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life 
if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself 
is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them 
however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative 
if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause

brinkley ar  dashcam video showing preferential treatment of an arkansas police chief has him scrambling to defend himself for being let off easy  without so much as a warning  after speeding to an offduty job as a referee at a football game 
footage obtained by thv from arkansas state police following a viewer tip shows brinkley police chief edward randle being pulled over in his personal vehicle a red pickup truck near clarendon on friday october  
a state trooper assisted an officer from the brinkley force upon request and makes a uturn after witnessing the speeding red pickup driving in the opposite direction to make the stop 
as the trooper approaches the drivers side dashcam video shows he immediately recognized the brinkley chief of police and laughingly asks where are you going so fast 
randle  obviously familiar to the state trooper  isnt asked to produce identification and tells the officer hes headed for the game which he later clarified for thv was the clarendonmarvell football game 
at that point the brinkley officer who had summoned state police for assistance with the stop also approaches randle  as the trooper tells the chief the officer had been tailing him for miles when he finally called for assistance 
i know you didnt call the state police randle quips to the brinkley officer 
i didnt have your plate the officer replies so it didnt go over 
as thv posits that statement could indicate that since the officer did not announce the trucks license plate number into his radio nobody else would know the chief had been pulled over 
the trio laughs about the chiefs excessive speed and the officer tells him i had you locked in at  
it wont do  itll only do  randle responds referring to a governor capping his trucks speed as he later explained to thv in an unrecorded interview 
after a few more laughs the officer tells randle he measured the trucks speed over  miles an hour  and the chief was still pulling away at the time 
despite the obvious dangers of such high speeds on the narrow curvy road both the trooper and brinkley officer simply walk away from the truck as the officer says dismissively see you later chief 
video captures the last exchange between the two cops as randle pulls away  the state trooper notes he clocked the chief doing  at the curve 
in two phone interviews with thv  which were not recorded by request  randle disputes he ever came close to the trucks alleged top possible speed of  as well as the troopers claim in dashcam footage he had been rounding the curve at  mph 
additionally though the state trooper claimed that the officer had been pursuing randle for miles randle told thv that the officer was on his way to clarendon to get fingerprints from someone at the county jail 
thv spoke with local business owner benjamin martin who first noticed the stop by a brinkley officer inside clarendon city limits 
i find it you know very disheartening that anyone public official or not would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit and put the lives of innocent others at risk martin told the station in a video interview 
i just feel that no ones above the law and you know if it was me i wouldve gotten a ticket 
indeed the public might be lucky the offduty brinkley police chief didnt lose control of his vehicle while traveling at such a high rate of speed  simply to make it to a football game 
neither the brinkley officer nor the state trooper are being investigated for wrongdoing  despite giving the chief a free pass arkansas state police told thv the incident fell under control of the brinkley police department as soon as the officer arrived on scene even though the trooper affected the stop 
as a chief of police and as a law enforcement officer youre sworn to protect and serve martin asserted which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk 
although nothing serious resulted from randles excessive speeds it was notorious blue privilege that allowed him to drive away without even a warning 
these seemingly small favors afforded to police by police on a constant basis highlight the divide civilians feel in their encounters with law enforcement indeed the idea police belong to an exclusive club of impunity  simply because of their chosen occupation  only increases tension and resentment in their communities 
if police dont uphold and enforce the laws they enforce against civilians the law becomes an arbitrary exploitive method for generating revenue  and nothing more share social trending",1

"are the polls rigged against trump all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct michael on television half of the population of the world is dirt poor  and the global elite want to keep it that way   nd  
could you survive on just  a day according to compassion international  approximately half of the population of the entire planet currently lives on  a day or less meanwhile those hoarding wealth at the very top of the global pyramid are rapidly becoming a lot wealthier dont get me wrong  i am a very big believer in working hard and contributing something of value to society and those that work the hardest and contribute the most should be able to reap the rewards in this article i am in no way shape or form criticizing true capitalism because if true capitalism were actually being practiced all over the planet we would have far far less poverty today instead our planet is dominated by a heavily socialized debtbased central banking system that systematically transfers wealth from hard working ordinary citizens to the global elite those at the very top of the pyramid know that they are impoverishing everyone else and they very much intend to keep it that way 
lets start with some of the hard numbers according to zero hedge  credit suisse had just released their yearly report on global wealth and it shows that  percent of all the wealth in the world is controlled by just  percent of the people 
as credit suisse tantalizingly shows year after year the number of people who control just shy of a majority of global net worth or  of the roughly  trillion in household wealth is declining progressively relative to the total population of the world and in  the number of people who are worth more than  million was just  million roughly  of the worlds population of adults on the other end of the pyramid some  billion adults had a net worth of less than  accounting for just about  trillion in household wealth 
and since this is a yearly report we can go back and see how things have changed over time when zero hedge did this it was discovered that the wealth of those at the very top has nearly doubled over the past six years and meanwhile the poor have gotten even poorer 
incidentally we tracked down the first credit suisse report we found in this series from   where the total wealth of the top layer in the pyramid was a modest  trillion for the worlds millionaires it has nearly doubled in the  years since then meanwhile the worlds poorest have gotten you got it poorer as those adults who were worth less than  in  had a combined net worth of  trillion a number which has since declined to  trillion in  despite a half a billion increase in the sample size 
if these trends continue at this pace it wont be too long before the global elite have virtually all of the wealth and the rest of us have virtually nothing 
perhaps you are fortunate enough to still have a good job and you live in a large home and you will sleep in a warm bed tonight 
well you should consider yourself to be very blessed because that is definitely not the case for most of the rest of the world the following  facts about global poverty come from dosomethingcom  and i want you to really let these numbers sink in for a moment nearly  of the worlds population  more than  billion people  live on less than  a day more than  billion live in extreme poverty  less than  a day  billion children worldwide are living in poverty according to unicef  children die each day due to poverty  million people worldwide do not have enough food to eat  food banks are especially important in providing food for people that cant afford it themselves run a food drive outside your local grocery store so people in your community have enough to eat sign up for supermarket stakeout  more than  million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water  diarrhea caused by inadequate drinking water sanitation and hand hygiene kills an estimated  people every year globally or approximately  people per day in   million children under the age  were stunted reduced rate of growth and development due to chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of  million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment as of   million children under  year of age worldwide had not received the three recommended doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis  of all humans live without electricity  approximately  billion people  of the world population lives on less than  a day  oxfam estimates that it would take  billion annually to end extreme global povertythats less than  the income of the top  richest billionaires the world food programme says the poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty hunger is the number one cause of death in the world killing more than hivaids malaria and tuberculosis combined 
so how did we get here 
debt is the primary mechanism that takes wealth from ordinary people like you and me and puts it into the hands of the global elite 
in my recent article entitled  why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money  i discussed how the federal reserve was designed to entrap the us government in an endless debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape and that is precisely what has happened as the us national debt has gotten more than  times larger since the federal reserve was created in  
in that very same year the federal income tax was instituted and that is a key part of the program for the global elite you see the income tax is how wealth is transferred from us to the government and then a continuously growing national debt is how that wealth is transferred from the government to the elite 
it is a very complicated system but at the end of the day it is all about taking money from us and getting it into their pockets 
and at this point more than  percent of the population of the world lives in a country with a central bank and almost every nation on the planet has some form of income tax 
it is a global system that is designed to create as much debt as possible and i recently shared with my readers that the total amount of debt in the world has hit a staggering   of  trillion dollars  
interestingly the bible actually foretells of a time when rich men would hoard wealth in the last days the following are the first five verses of the book of james in the modern english version  
come now you rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten  your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have stored up treasures for the last days  indeed the wages that you kept back by fraud from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying and the cries of those who harvested have entered into the ears of the lord of hosts  you have lived in pleasure on the earth and have been wayward you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter 
so much of the time we focus on the other great sins that we see all around us but the truth is that one of the greatest sins of all in our world today is the sin of greed 
the borrower is the servant of the lender and the global elite have used various forms of debt to turn the rest of the planet into their debt slaves 
as debt levels race higher and higher all over the planet the elite are using the magic of compound interest to grab a bigger and bigger share of the pie 
given enough time those at the very top would have virtually everything and the rest of us would have virtually nothing the middle class is shrinking all over the globe and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to grow at an astounding pace 
but the vast majority of people out there have no idea how money debt taxes and central banks really work and so they have no idea that this is purposely being done to them 
so please share this article with as many people as you can the truth is that we dont have to have this much global poverty and if we correctly identify the root causes of this poverty we can start working on some real solutions",1

hillary clintons campaign accused fbi director james comey monday of engaging in a blatant double standard

"will it be representative government or thugocracy exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty published  mins ago about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen barack obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

"oregon live 
juror  vigorously defends the acrosstheboard acquittals of ammon bundy and his six codefendants calling the rulings a statement about the prosecutions failure to prove the fundamental elements of a conspiracy charge 
the fulltime marylhurst university business administration student was the juror who had sent a note to the judge on the fourth day of the initial jurys deliberations in the case questioning the impartiality of a fellow juror no  who the judge bounced from the jury a day later 
it should be known that all  jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count itself  and not any form of affirmation of the defenses various beliefs actions or aspirations juror  wrote friday in a lengthy email to the oregonianoregonlive 
he expressed relief that he can now speak out freely but he wasnt ready as of friday morning to drop his anonymity he said his studies have suffered since the trial started and hes not ready for the attention revealing his identity would bring but felt it was important to defend the verdict the judge withheld jurors names during the jury selection process and trial instead referring to each by number 
the jury closely followed us district judge anna j browns instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence and testimony heard during the fiveweek trial he said 
the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty to conspiracy charges against all seven defendants each was accused of conspiring to prevent employees of the us fish and wildlife service and bureau of land management from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force during the day occupation 
juror  noted the panel couldnt simply rely on the defendantsdefining actions to convict 
all  agreed that impeding existed even if as an effect of the occupation he wrote 
but we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings rather to decide if any agreement was made with an illegal object in mind the marylhurst student wrote it seemed this basic high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout 
prosecutors had argued that the case at its core was about the illegal taking of anothers property the heavily armed guards that manned the front gate and watchtower during the day takeover in and of itself was intimidating and prevented officers from the us fish and wildlife service and us bureau of land management from carrying out their work they said 
they argued that the alleged conspiracy began nov  when ammon bundy and ally ryan payne met with harney county sheriff dave ward and promised there would be extreme civil unrest in the community if he didnt step in and block harney county ranchers dwight hammond jr and steven hammond the hammonds were slated to return to federal prison on jan  and serve out a mandatory minimum fiveyear sentence for arson on federal land 
defense lawyers urged jurors in closing arguments not to mixup the effect of the occupation  which undoubtedly kept federal employees from doing their jobs  from the intent of the occupiers 
five of the seven defendants including ammon bundy testified many said that they were there to protest in support of the hammonds and federal government overreach because they received absolutely no response from state or local government officials to their previous efforts to spur change 
the defense lawyers arguments coupled with the jury instructions on how to apply the law to the evidence resonated with jurors juror  noted 
inference while possibly compelling proved to be insulting or inadequate to  diversely situated people as a means to convict the juror wrote the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us nor was it warranted given their burden of proof 
juror  plainly stated that fellow juror  during the initial round of deliberations had zero business being on this jury in the first place 
juror  had worked for the us bureau of land management as a ranch tech and firefighter more than  years ago he had said during jury selection asked by the judge during voir dire if that experience would impede his ability to be a fair and impartial judge of the facts he said not really 
juror  explained why he didnt alert the court immediately after he had heard juror  on day one of deliberations reportedly say i am very biased 
it wasnt until the fourth day into deliberations that juror  sent a note to the court asking if a juror who had worked previously for the federal land management agency and outright told the panel he was very biased could be an impartial judge the court flummoxed by the development a day later dismissed juror  for good cause after the prosecution and defense teams agreed to the dismissal at the time parties to the case werent sure which way juror s alleged bias fell 
juror  said he resisted the impulse to send the question sooner in an effort to give his fellow juror a chance to explain himself 
in his email to the oregonianoregonlive juror  for the first time also contended that juror  violated the judges explicit orders by hearkening to evidence that was never admitted in this case refused to consider the defendants state of mind and used imaginative theories to explain key actions 
juror  said though he wishes that he had sent the letter on day one since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us 
the maryville business student said he is baffled by what he described as observersflippant sentiments in the wake of the jurys acquittals 
dont they know that not guilty does not mean innocent he wrote it was not lost on us that our verdicts might inspire future actions that are regrettable but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us 
the jury he said met with judge brown after the verdicts were announced and after the us marshals physical confrontation and arrest of bundy lawyer marcus mumford 
he said many of the jurors questioned the judge about why the federal government chose the conspiracy charge he said he learned that a potential alternate charge such as criminal trespass wouldnt have brought as significant a penalty 
the charge of conspiring to impede federal employees from carrying out their official work through intimidation threat or force brings a maximum sentence of six years in prison 
we all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this conspiracy charge seemed the best possible option juror  said

"vitamin d deficiency dirty air doubles your risk of dementia  in  americans will struggle with alzheimers by  image credits geraltpixabay  
dementia is one of the most common and debilitating illnesses that older americans face today 
however recent studies have suggested that air pollution may be one of the top causes for the contribution of the diseases growth 
by   in  americans will suffer from alzheimers alzheimers is the most potent form of dementia and often ends in the patient unable to remember how to do daily and necessary tasks like eating or using the restroom this will rival the current diabetes and obesity crises seen today 
recent studies have confirmed that a variety of environmental factors are at play when it comes to dementia 
doctors have noted that those who are deficient in vitamin d are  more likely to develop dementia than those who get in the necessary amount 
a vitamin d deficiency can also be associated with brittle or soft bones as well as depression it is recommended that everyone gets at least  minutes of sunlight per day in order to ensure they have enough vitamin d as well as eat fortified dairy products or salmon liver and red meat vitamin d can also be obtained through supplementation or fish oil 
however doctors have found that the biggest environmental risk for dementia lies in air pollution 
in fact the problem is so great that those who live in a city with high pollution can double their risk of develop dementia within  or  months living there 
recent studies have also shown that postmortem examinations of the brains of those who have lived in highly polluted areas contain traces of magnetite this chemical compound may be partially responsible for the memory impairments associated with dementia 
the risk of developing dementia if you are exposed to air pollution increases exponentially if you are obese 
researchers say that those concerned about the epidemic can combat it by living somewhere with as little pollution as possible maintaining a health intake of vitamin d and exercising 
according to research exercise is imperitive when it comes to staving off the illness dr laura baker who ran a study on dementia and exercise stated 
these findings are important because they strongly suggest a potent lifestyle intervention such as aerobic exercise can impact alzheimersrelated changes in the brain no currently approved medication can rival these effects newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",0

low cholesterol and its consequence 

previously we have seen that cholesterol is a critical element of our cells and tissues  in addition scientific evidence suggests that high cholesterol is not necessarily harmful but offers a protective effect against brain disorders such as alzheimers disease  at this point we should ask the opposite question what about if we have too little cholesterol what are the consequences 

without cholesterol we would die 
it is well known today that cholesterol performs several important functions in the body one of the best important is not the most important function of cholesterol is to assist the proper regulation of the immune system indeed people who have a low blood cholesterol have an anergic immune system ie a lack of reaction by the bodys defense mechanisms to foreign substances vredevoe et al  in other words your body cannot fight off pathogens such as bacteria viruses parasites and fungi without cholesterol the different cells involved in an immune response such as macrophages lymphocytes etc cannot recognize the invaders and destroy them interestingly it was shown that the ldl particles are the ones needed for an adequate immune response masterjohn  these particles neutralize microbes and toxins before they cause any damage to the tissuesorgans and we call these ldl particles bad cholesterol without them we would be dead another fact is that a low blood cholesterol increases our risks of developing tuberculosis 
more importantly a sufficient supply of cholesterol to the immune system is critical to eliminate cancer cells indeed cholesterol is needed to slow down the progression of cancer in addition to cholesterol saturated fats like palmitic and myristic acids are also necessary for an optimum immune system these fats are found in tropical oil such as coconut oil would this fact explain why asian people have a lower rate of cancer than north americans 

is cholesterol protective not causative of heart disease 
there is a tremendous amount of evidence to suggest that microbial infections are one of the primary drive force of plaque accumulation in the arteries of the heart   in support of this a lack of buccal hygiene considerably increases your risk of heart disease  some researchers have noticed that people who suffered from a heart attack also had the flu a few days prior   it seems that those microorganisms change the structure of the blood vessels leading to inflammation and an accumulation of plaques at the sites of injury based on this evidence we can propose that cholesterol actually minimizes the risk of developing heart disease via the elimination of dangerous pathogens indeed it seems to be the case  
it is time to end this war on cholesterol science is very clear cholesterol does not cause heart disease on the contrary cholesterol is a vital element of a vibrant health by making sure the immune system is strong by being a critical component of vitamin d synthesis by helping the body make sex hormones among other functions",0

steve taylor phd  from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them 
egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success 
as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent 
in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there  like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there  how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness 
however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves  and make ourselves significant  by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions 
this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth 
the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness 
i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration  something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there 
there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other 
as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan 
the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands 
the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names 
the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off 
witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging 
their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status 
i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows 
as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness 
however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world 
tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity 
there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection 
in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep

"former united states attorney for the district of columbia joe digenova suggested friday james comeys reopening of the investigation into hillary clintons emails was the product of a revolt inside the fbi 
while speaking with wmals larry oconnor  digenova was asked what comey meant by saying newly discovered clinton emails from anthony weiner and huma abedins devices appear to be pertinent to the fbis prior investigation 
it tells me that the original investigation was not thorough and that it was an incompetent investigation digenova said otherwise they would have discovered this  and ill tell you why 
these were found on the phone that was used by anthony weiner and huma abedin he said why was that phone not looked at originally 
there could be one explanation huma abedin may have denied that any other phone existed and if she did she committed a felony she lied to the fbi just like general cartwright and if she did shes dead meat and comey knows it and theres nothing he can do about it 
digenova continued and why this letter was sent today was very simple the agents came to comey yesterday they told him about the evidence and he said oh s and realized that his goose was cooked that this would prove conclusively that his original investigation was incompetent and he knew that the agents running the weiner case would leak it if he did not send this letter to congress 
and ive also been told something very significant its been reported that those laptops belonging to clinton aides cheryl mills and heather samuelson were destroyed they were not and the reason is the fbi agents refused to do it 
digenova went on to say he believes there is a quiet but serious revolt against the director right now 
he sent those letters today because he is in deep trouble inside the bureau he said comey sent this letter today because he had to he has no moral authority inside the agency right now hes a joke hes a laughingstock of the agency and among former fbi agents he has become an anathema

benghazi consulate attackers used militarystyle tactics say us officials  
experts still unsure whether assault that killed  americans in libya could have been prevented  
by matt apuzzo and kimberly dozier   
september    am  washington ap  the heavily armed extremists who laid siege to the us consulate in libya used militarystyle tactics that may have steered americans toward a waiting ambush us officials said friday as they pieced together details about how the compound was overrun 

us intelligence indicates that  or more people many of them masked were responsible for the sept  assault on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi gun trucks provided added firepower the attackers set up a perimeter controlling access in and out of the compound a first wave of attacks sent the americans fleeing to a fallback building where a second group of extremists beset them with precise mortar fire 

intelligence reports were still coming in but officials told the associated press that what may have initially seemed like a protest over an antiislam movie that had spun out of control now showed the hallmarks of a more sophisticated operation 

in a country coming off a civil war a level of battlefield savvy does not prove the attack on the compound was planned well in advance how much planning went into the operation and whether it could have been detected or prevented remain unanswered questions officials said 

the attacks killed ambassador chris stevens diplomat sean smith and two former navy seals who us officials said were security officers guarding diplomatic officials stevens was visiting benghazi from tripoli to preside over the opening of an american space cultural center 

the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence reports they stressed that even now authorities do not have a clear understanding of exactly what happened in benghazi fbi agents from new york and washington were in libya investigating the attack 

what happened in benghazi was a terrorist attack secretary of state hillary clinton said friday and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four americans 

officials have not singled out one responsible group but have focused their attention on ansar alshariah a libyan militant group led by a former detainee at the us militaryrun prison in guantanamo bay cuba 

since the civil war that ousted libyan dictator moammar gadhafi last year the country has been awash with rebels militias and terrorists weaponry is easy to come by both from the former regime from weapons depots looted during the war and from foreign powers that armed the rebellion the origin of the weapons used in the assault on the us compound was unclear officials said

an angry john podesta issues a statement on reopening of fbi probe

oct    pm while hillary has yet to address todays stunning letter by fbi director comey who reported that the federal bureau of investigations has opened a probe into hillary clintons email as a result of findings on what the nyt reported was an electronic device belonging to anthony wiener a clearly angry john podesta clintons recently hacked campaign chair issued the following statement in response to fbi letter to gop congressional chairmen 

in response to the letter sent by fbi director james convey to eight republican committee chairman in congress hillary for america chair john podesta released the following statement friday 

upon completing this investigation more than three months ago fbi director comet declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call in the months since donald trump and his republican allies have been baselessly secondguessing the fbi and in both public and private browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm hillary clintons presidential campaign

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

sunday october   by ethan a huff staff writer tags herculex  yield guard  crop failures naturalnews the utter failure of geneticallymodified crops gmos is once again on full display this time with crop products made by companies other than the usual monsanto  a novel variety of transgenic corn produced and marketed by both dow chemical corporation and dupont is not exactly working as claimed new reports indicate and agricultural experts are urging the chemical industry to immediately cease selling these failed products to farmersknown as herculex the synthetic corn in question contains a gene modification thats supposed to prevent a pest known as the western bean cutworm from destroying crops but so far the genetic alteration has done nothing to stop this worm which means farmers everywhere have been paying through their teeth for a technology that not only doesnt work  but thats also proprietary and exceptionally costly especially when compared to nongmo and organic crops that are opensource and are not patented or owned by multinational corporationsa group of six entomologists published an open letter to the seed industry in a recent issue of purdue universitys pest  crop newsletter  calling on those involved to do the right thing and fess up to the fact that herculex doesnt work farmers will soon be gearing up to plant next years crops and they need to know that its best to look elsewhere for corn thats not going to result in massive yield reductionspeople are frustrated and angry and more importantly yield was lost the letter states before growers make seed choices for  we again urge the seed industry to acknowledge the reality of what is happening in the field dupont quietly admits herculex doesnt work but refuses to take responsibility in typical corporate fashion the owners of herculex are refusing to take the letter seriously resorting instead to excuses and legal speak to try to explain away the gm crops failure rather than pull the herculex product from the market dupont according to bloomberg  has instead decided to merely decreased its efficiency rating in the companys  product use guide from very good to moderatedupont has also issued an accompanying statement urging farmers to add other inputs to try to control cutworms including spraying additional chemical insecticides in other words herculex doesnt actually work and duponts solution is to have farmers just go ahead and blast away with all those endocrinedisrupting cancercausing chemicals to kill anything and everything that might be living on or around the crop its basically the same advice that monsanto is giving to farmers who foolishly adopted a similar gm corn product known as yieldgard that was supposed to deter the western corn root worm the insecticidal proteins in this crop product just like the one in herculex  known as cryf  havent lived up to all the wild marketing claims and yet both monsanto and duponts products continue to be sold to farmerscryf has failed in our states the letter continues adding that the scientists involved have already received dozens of calls and emails about the problem from concerned farmers for growers in our states the costs of scouting and spraying cryf corn negates a major reason they purchased and planted a hybrid with the trait in the first placeif left to run their course western bean cutworms and western corn root rooms will effectively eat up all the corn kernels and leave the plant defenseless encouraging the growth of harmful fungi and mycotoxins and since none of what the chemical industry has proposed as a solution is working their only recommended option is to spray more glyphosate dicamba d and other chemicals on their products sources for this article include",0
"by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters todo list 
as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  
the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting 
over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome 
according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  
another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  
the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party",1
"a complaint has been filed against fbi director james comey with department of justice office of professional responsibility that accuses him of interfering in a presidential election 
the democratic coalition against trump released a statement announcing their complaint the democratic coalition against trump filed a complaint with the department of justice office of professional responsibility on friday against fbi director james comey for interfering in the presidential election following the fbis decision to open up an investigation into secretary clintons emails this close to election day federal employees are forbidden from participating in political activities under the hatch act 
it is absolutely absurd that fbi director comey would support donald trump like this with only  days to go before the election said scott dworkin senior advisor to the democratic coalition against trump it is an obvious attack from a lifelong republican who used to serve in the bush white house just to undermine her campaign comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting america not investigating our soon to be presidentelect hillary clinton 
outrage is growing over comeys actions as details about the fbi investigation have revealed that it has nothing to do with clinton her emails or her server 
director comeys motives for sending the letter  days before a presidential election have been questioned by both republicans and democrats 
if comeys actions were politically motivated he would be in violation of the hatch act 
what republicans initially viewed as a new hope in the presidential election has quickly been exposed as a desperately political ploy 
the american people deserve a full explanation from director comey because the letter that was released today raises more questions than answers",0

"by jason easley on fri oct th  at  pm if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column he will have to spend some of his very limited time money and resources there because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week share on twitter print this post 
if donald trump wants to keep arizona in the republican column he will have to spend some of his very limited time money and resources there because hillary clinton is campaigning in the red state next week 
the clinton announced that the democratic nominee would be spending part of the last week of the campaign in arizona on wednesday november   hillary clinton will campaign in phoenix arizona days before election day clinton will lay out what is at stake in the election with more people voting in this election than any in history clinton will urge arizona voters to take advantage of inperson early voting voters can check their registration status and early vote location at iwillvotecom 
the fact that clinton will be in usually reliably red arizona in november during the final week of the presidential campaign tells voters all they need to know about the state of the presidential race 
hillary clinton is in such a good position that she can afford to spend some time during the last week of the campaign trying to turn red states blue 
the trump campaign already deployed vp nominee mike pence to utah in a bid to save that dark red state from falling and it looks like they will have to devote resources to saving arizona to prevent clinton from winning a state that has been a given for republicans in previous elections 
the trump campaign is broke the nominee had to give his campaign  million so that they could afford to buy air time in battleground states for their ads 
the clinton campaign is trying to stretch trump past his breaking point by making a serious play for arizona it is a brilliant move from a campaign that has outwitted its republican opponent at every turn",0

this fall the us agreed to provide  billion in military aid to israel over the next ten years ensuring americas continued role in funding the occupation of palestine meanwhile my friends and colleagues here in gaza live in fear of another significant israeli attack in the near future 
they have every reason to fear another major escalation  violence is a daily reality in gaza in two recent incidents a rocket was fired from gaza into israel without causing damage or injuries and in both instances israel responded by bombing targets throughout gaza 
in august alone israel bombed more than  locations in the small territory  
the simple story told about these events focuses on action and reaction palestinians attacked israel with a rocket and israel responded we hear this logic after nearly every event of this sort but its woefully incomplete 
in both instances the rockets fired werent fired by hamas but rather by small radical armed groups at odds with hamas which governs gaza these groups seek to incite israeli attacks on hamas with the goal of destabilizing its control over gaza because they see hamas as too comfortable with the status quo 
since seizing power in  hamas has worked to control and limit violence from the territory outside of periods of defined military escalation  which tend to be precipitated by israeli attacks  they have effectively stopped attacks against israel from gaza 
this explains why as noted by the israeli press there were only  rockets fired from gaza towards israel between january and august this year none were fired by hamas so israels decision to target hamas as a response makes no sense 
of course  rockets fired from gaza is  too many for those of us committed to ending all violence and none of this should be taken as an apology for other violence perpetrated by hamas 
but as the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in the occupied palestinian territories reports  there were also  israeli military incursions into gaza this year resulting in  palestinian deaths and on average injuring five palestinians in gaza every week 
this is the part of the story that isnt told 
gaza also remains under an israeliimposed blockade that severely limits travel trade and life for gazans despite assurances that restrictions would be lifted in the  hamasisrael ceasefire agreement the blockade remains in effect 
israel with support from the us government claims this decadeslong blockade is in place to pressure the people of gaza to rise up against hamas and provide security for israelis 
if those are israels raisons detre then its a complete failure it hasnt stopped violence it hasnt weakened hamas and it hasnt brought israelis or palestinians security 
while the blockade hasnt succeeded in achieving the changes israel claims to be seeking its impact on the civilian population of gaza has been immense 
over two years after the end of the last large military operation there much of gaza remains in ruins 
of the  palestinians in gaza who were displaced during the  israeli bombardment over  remain homeless as  percent of the homes seriously damaged or destroyed havent been rebuilt this is largely because reconstruction materials remain blocked from entering gaza 
this important context is too often missing as us pundits and politicians consider the situation in gaza 
given the blockade and regular military incursions imposed by israel the firing of less than  rockets per month by palestinians cannot be seen as the core reason for violence 
if the us is serious about promoting peace between israelis and palestinians preventing future violence in gaza and guaranteeing security then it must recognize the violence inherent in the israeli occupation and end the blockade 
the next attack on gaza feared by my friends who live there is an inevitable reality if nothing changes 
mike merrymanlotze has worked with the american friends service committee as the palestineisrael program director since

"half of russians fear syria could spark ww  
russia today almost half of all respondents in a recent russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between russia and the west caused by the ongoing crisis in syria could develop into a global military conflict 
the share of those who see the probability of world war three in the near future as high or very high is now at  percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise  percent of society the privatelyowned public opinion research center levada reported on monday the remaining  percent of respondents said they couldnt give a simple answer to the question 
when researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that russia and the west would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis  percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely thirtynine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and  percent said that they couldnt answer the question 
just over half   percent  of russians said they approve of their countrys involvement in the syrian conflict and  percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this just under a quarter   percent  couldnt answer the question about their personal view on the subject those who thought that russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided  percent against  percent respectively with  percent finding the question too difficult to answer 
the level of awareness about the situation in syria and the russian air force operation against islamic state is formerly isisisil terrorists there remained fairly high eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in syria and  percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue just under a fifth   percent  said that they were not interested in news about syria 
a similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent levada center showed that over  percent of russian citizens supported the air operations against is terrorists in syria and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for russia to support the government of syrias democraticallyelected president bashar assad 
a different poll conducted earlier this month by the staterun research center vtsiom showed that  percent of russians believed that western criticism of the air forces counterterrorism operation in aleppo syria was ungrounded and prejudiced only  percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the russian military have some basis in reality 
russia first deployed an air force contingent in syria in  after receiving a request for military help from the syrian government which is currently battling islamic state and affiliated groups russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in syria on september   their work has aided the syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country",0

"study running linked to extended lifespan and brain repair

"print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc 
earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot 
in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots 
after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson 
that triggered a quick backandforth between david jones and anderson 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate 
he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy 
in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true 
its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed 
the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said 
its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said 
jones is standing by her story  percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit 
i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename 
get the hottest most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just  seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts 
another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week 
neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot 
they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that jones said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight 
i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened 
the following are three images of the democratic party materials jena and david jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot 
the following are two images from democrats who say the voters must be confused",1
"with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief the day of reckoning has arrived  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in  but not so much for hillary in  the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for hillary 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla the lizard would have his vote we have seen the hillary koolaid drinkers go crazy after donald won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption 
i have seen a lot of domestic antitrump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism 
but fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states 
i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in  
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief far worse 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the  families and their  minions that is according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass 
fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america you never read that in our corporate media 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the  presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here  these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole  trillion from us i think they stole a lot more 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in  when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in  it became law in  just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in  the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the  families that sent them 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing 
if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years 
so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat 
in short a race war to end all wars 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning 
the day of reckoning has arrived 
the  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long 
the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse",0

"home  be the change  nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time jay syrmopoulos august    comments 
washington dc  one of the architects of the national security agencys surveillance programs dropped a bombshell over the weekend when he stated that the nsa has all of hillary clintons deleted emails he also noted that the fbi has the technical and legal ability to gain access to them if they chose to do so 
william binney is a former highly respected nsa official that served the agency for over  years helping to create its surveillance program  before becoming a famed whistleblower upon resigning in  on sunday he declared in a radio interview broadcast that the hack of the dnc could have been coordinated by someone inside the us intelligence community angry over clintons compromise of national security data with her email use 
appearing on sunday on aaron klein investigative radio and speaking as an intelligence analyst binney questioned whether the hack of the democratic national committees servers were actually the work of russian hackers as the clinton camp has alleged instead he raised the possibility that it was actually the work of disgruntled us intelligence officials upset about clinton being given a pass on criminal charges after compromising national security secrets through her use of unsecure personal email servers that were undoubtedly accessed by numerous foreign intelligence services 
during his interview with reporter aaron klein binney referenced thenfbi director robert s muellers testimony in march  before the senate judiciary committee in which mueller spoke of the fbis ability to access a number of secretive databases to track down known and suspected terrorists 
now what he mueller is talking about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the edward snowden material released which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight of by the way so that means that nsa and a number of agencies in the us government also have those emails binney said so if the fbi really wanted them they can go into that database and get them right now binney stated in regards to the missing clinton emails 
when klein asked whether he believed the nsa has copies of all of clintons emails including the deleted correspondence binney replied with a oneword bombshell yes  he responded that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there 
according to a report by breitbart  
and the other point is that hillary according to an article published by the observer in march of this year has a problem with nsa because she compromised gamma material now that is the most sensitive material at nsa and so there were a number of nsa officials complaining to the press or to the people who wrote the article that she did that she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma reporting that is a direct compromise of the most sensitive material at the nsa so shes got a real problem there so there are many people who have problems with what she has done in the past so i dont necessarily look at the russians as the only ones who got into those emails 
the observer defined the gamma classification 
gamma compartment which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information for instance decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership as this was 
how interesting to think about the distinct possibility that the hacked and leaked emails are not the result of russian hackers but actually came to wikileaks from an unknown crusader at the nsa itself  another snowden if you will 
let us hope that after for years of watching clinton expose national security secrets through reckless handling of highly classified intelligence some determined patriots within the intelligence community are now working to see the downfall of clintons by exposing their corrupt political apparatus likely we will never know as zero hedge reported  it is the nsa that has been tasked with determining if the russian government is behind the hacks one thing we already know is that when an agency investigates itself it never finds itself responsible share",1
like most people on election day i expected hillary clinton to become president i could not have been in a better setting to find out the tides were turning,1
"college reform october   
grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive 
campus reform reached out to grinnell for a comment on the matter but did not receive a response in time for publication this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article",0
"keywords alzhemiers disease  anxiety  dementia  depression  food  health  ibd  ibs  immune system  mental health  nutrition  weight loss fermented foods  reasons to consume this food group every day 
im sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily what are fermented foods 
bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost the bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lactofermentation the yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation 
these yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food what it does to the food provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health provides beneficial enzymes increases the amount of b vitamins biotin and folate increases the bioavailability of minerals provides short chain fatty acids which helps to improve your immune function provides you with gaba your calming neurotransmitter how can eating fermented foods help me optimize your gut health 
why this may not seem like a big deal it is your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut your gut may be in bad shape from nsaids antibiotics unknown food allergies the standard american diet and more 
ideally you want more good bacteria populating your gut as opposed to bad bacteria fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the standard american crap food diet have a disrupted microbiome 
so you can take all the supplements in the world but if your gut is in bad shape are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money 
a healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system immune system digestive system and nervous system so as you can see a healthy gut is critical to your wellbeing support your immune system 
the more beneficial bacteria you have the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds flu allergies and more almost  of your immune system is found in your gut thus it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system one needs to support their gut health 
asthma and autoimmune conditions among numerous other health issues are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut the less diverse your microbiota is the greater association with many chronic health issues 
adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection aid in weight loss 
studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weightdifficulty losing weight obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals 
in a  study it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study in a  study obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for  weeks those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group digestivebowel issue improvement 
those with ibs or ibd may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet dr david williams states that to eliminate digestive issues you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods kefir in studies has shown to improve symptoms of ibs and ibd research has shown that anywhere from  to  of those who make this change adding in fermented foods will notice a significant difference in their ibs symptoms improved mental health mood control and behavior 
the gut is considered your second brain a healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies for this reason to get more variety of probiotic strains it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over mix it up for instance have kefir one day kombucha the next fermented vegetables the next day and so forth 
many of you know that gaba is your calming neurotransmitter but did you know that fermented foods can supply you with gaba too oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase gaba content significantly whereas gaba in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues 
another study looking at  college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety fear moodiness worry envy frustration and loneliness 
it is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed gaba even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders reduce the risk of brain diseases such as alzheimers 
some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that alzheimers disease is in fact an autoimmune disease and as many of you may know having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road for any autoimmune disease the immune system must be supported so it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for ad if you want to support your brain than i suggest that you add in fermented foods 
along with the benefits above fermented foods can also benefit those with autism and help prevent hpylori you dont need a whole lot of fermented foods daily start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say  tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day what to add in 

look for the product to say raw and fermented these foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables  eat these cold dont heat them up bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods kimchee  this is a korean version of fermented cabbage carrots onions and garlic kefir usually made from cows milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk it has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt i buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast if you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir if you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion avoid the kefir until issues resolve opt for the other fermented choices instead tempeh indonesian type of cake with a nutty taste and chewy texture a good vegan source of protein too kombucha  a fizzy fermented tea most stores carry a variety of flavors now dont go overboard on the kombucha however some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts ie several bottles per day report symptoms of gas and bloating miso a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces a miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make 
notice i did not sat yogurt while some yogurts may contain some probiotics many others are sugary processed foods in disguise yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the abovementioned foods

"the rothschild family has corrupted global banks news media oil and government share in central banks  currency  debt  deception  energy  freedom 
the new world order might seem a bit farfetched for many a handful of powerful people acting as puppet masters for the human race is a thought that might not even cross the minds of many that have seamlessly adapted to the beliefs that were instilled in them from a young age the thought that we are all being controlled and enslaved by the banks with the aid of the government is for conspiracy theorists there is no doubt that there are negative connotations associated with being a conspiracy theorist that belief has been reiterated many times mostly from the mainstream media there are people who see the world for what they are told it is others see whats really going on behind the curtain the stranglehold the global elite have on money and knowledge makes them very powerful they either directly or indirectly control every aspect of our lives 
global megacorporations make up to billions of dollars on an annual basis a select few at the top of the company make absurd amounts of money while the employees making the difference and driving the company forward are barely paid enough money to stay afloat if humans stay busy working  weekly hours for very little income they wont have the time or the resources to realize they have been dealt a bad hand the top  percent doesnt want americans to be any more educated then to have the ability to help operate and patronize their business 
the global elite have a system in place which allows them to grow their global banking empire all of humanity are literally slaves to the economic system money is necessary for our survival in the real world today most people will spend the majority of their time working just to survive in the system if money is the god of our time that makes rothschild his prophet public school programs worldwide are where the global elite first begin to shape our minds they continue the shaping through the media we are taught what they want us to know and nothing more 
the rich continue to get richer by purchasing up many successful smaller businesses when the top  percent owns the majority of banks resources and even our governments it means big problems for the people the rothschilds are worth over  trillion and they are just  of  families that pretty much collectively own the world the rothschilds alone could pay off the us national debt  times over unfortunately they would never do such a thing because they own the majority of the worlds central banks the new world orders agenda is slowly taking small steps toward complete and definitive enslavement through use of the monetary system and ownership of resources

"interviews syria should be able to choose its allies in the battle against daesh says american political analyst james petras 
the pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the daesh isil terrorist group in syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group says james petras an american political commentator 
us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
he claimed that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country 
i dont believe that the attack on raqqah is a positive move because i think it brings the us closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern syria which will directly affect the efforts of the syrian government and its alliesiran and russiato defend the country 
the analyst noted that raqqah is a problem for the syrian people and damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle 
petras went on to note that carters remarks bear similarities to us democratic presidential candidate hillary clintons plans for a conflagration in the middle east 
the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power 
carters claim that us ground forces will have no part in the fight against daesh came at a time when more than  american soldiers were stationed in iraq tasked with providing training and intelligence to iraqi forces loading",1

donald trump promised that he would bring millions of new republicans voters into the election but polling in swing states shows that it is hillary clinton who is getting new voters out to support her 
within their discussion of a new pennsylvania poll showing clinton leading trump by  points the new york times reported 
mrs clinton has an point lead among voters who did not participate in the  election according to our estimates which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data she fares even better among white voters who didnt vote in  than she does among white voters who did its a pattern that has been true across all of the upshotsiena surveys in florida north carolina and pennsylvania 
there has not been an influx of new voters who might help mr trump according to our estimates mrs clinton has a point lead among newly registered voters 
the idea that trump was bringing millions of new voters to the republican party was always a myth 
donald trump got the most votes of any candidate in a republican presidential primary trump also set the record for most votes cast against in a republican primary trump is one of the few nominees in history to have a majority of his partys primary ballots cast against him 
hillary clinton is the candidate who is attracting millions of new voters and without a doubt some of those voters have been motivated by donald trumps campaign 
trump was right he has brought millions of new voters to the polls what he neglected to tell republicans is that they are coming for hillary clinton",0
"public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power ryan mcmaken  misesorg  october   comments 
in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that donald trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  
trumps position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  
while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases 
this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups 
in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply 
in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens 
in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing 
this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low 
contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today 
when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself 
the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland 
it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority 
it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority 
these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state 
in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard 
voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power 
in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege 
the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",0

gop nominee donald trump who has for weeks warned that the election could be rigged against him shot out a tweet thursday indicating that he is aware of reports of machines flipping to register votes for hillary clinton when voters choose trump 
a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas trump tweeted 
people are not happy big lines what is going on a lot of callins about vote flipping at the voting booths in texas people are not happy big lines what is going on 
 donald j trump realdonaldtrump october   
as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right 
weve seen polls tighten since the third debate and we expect things to get even closer before election day mook said urging clinton supporters to vote 
make no mistake with only  percent of votes cast donald trump could win this election mook said   ",0

food waste and hunger are enormous global environmental and public health problems as overwhelming as these issues are community groups volunteers local businesses and organizations are working on trying to find a solution 
what started as a social action project in  a few members of a small community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste 
and theyre succeeding 
the project grew into a nonprofit organization with a team of more than  volunteer drivers a network of more than  donors and frontline agencies who feed the hungry on a daily basis 
amazingly the entire group has rescued more than  million pounds of food  enough to provide  million meals heres more of this motivating againstallodds story food waste and hunger 
about a third of the planets food goes to waste thats enough to feed two billion people 
the united nations environment programme unep and the world resources institute wri report that about onethird of all food produced worldwide  worth around  trillion  are lost or wasted in food production and consumption systems 
furthermore the natural resources defense council nrdc cites the following 
forty percent of the food in the united states is never eaten but at the same time one in eight americans struggles to put enough food on the table 
nearly  million people worldwide suffer from hunger  but according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations we squander enough food  globally  trillion pounds a year  to feed every one of them more than twice over 
in developing nations much of the food is lost after harvest because of the lack of refrigeration good roads and adequate storage facilities on the other hand developed nations waste more food when retailers order display or serve too much 
additionally consumers waste food when they ignore leftovers in the back of their refrigerators  or toss perishable food out before it expires more alarming statistics of wasted food 
much of the wasted food in the us ends up in landfills the us environmental protection agency epa reports that food waste is the second largest category of municipal solid waste sent to landfills in the united states 
and it accounts for about  percent of the waste stream thats more than  million tons of food waste that the us sends to the landfills each year 
additionally according to nrdc on average people dining out leave  percent of meals uneaten and  percent of these potential leftovers are not taken home 
in spite of the dismal statistics on food waste  and the struggles and pain hungry people endure  community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers in metroatlanta georgia are making headway in not wasting food and feeding people in need people are fed perishable food not wasted 
more than ten years ago a few members of a community in metroatlanta georgia took up the challenge to feed people in need and eliminate food waste they wanted to take leftover fresh food from grocery stores and restaurants and quickly deliver it to agencies that provide food to families and individuals in need 
since the first delivery was made in  the group has rescued more than  million pounds of food and the group believes this figure equals enough to provide more than  million meals 
as success mounted in eliminating food waste and feeding people in their community the group established itself as a nonprofit organization called second helpings atlanta  now second helpings atlanta has  donors  partner agencies and a team of more than  volunteer drivers who pick up and drop off perishable food every day 
executive director joe labriola says the challenge is getting the food from those who have it to those who need it and thats what we do we play a very specific role we do  scheduled pickups and deliveries a week weve gotten pretty good at this fresh food versus nonperishable 
fresh food provides more nutrition than the nonperishable processed diet that so many people eat  especially people with low or no income one of second helpings atlantas goals is to change that standard offering fresh food that will ideally help prompt healthier eating habits 
this year the group has delivered  pounds of food and labriola estimates they will pick up and deliver more than  million pounds by the end of the year 
the reason were so focused on perishable food is that were providing nutrition to the diets of people who are surviving on processed food were breaking the cycle and hope that some of the health benefits of fresh food will start to kick in 
according to labriola he sees no reason why this type of food waste program cant easily be adopted anywhere he adds that  percent of the food produced in the us is never consumed and the average annual cost per household of food that is thrown out is  
twenty percent of people in georgia live in a foodinsecure environment  meaning theyre not sure when theyre going to eat next its a pretty grim story labriola says but if we rescue just  percent of that food we can feed  million americans how its working 
when people sign up to volunteer theyre shown the available routes then theyre asked to choose the route that would work best with their location and schedule 
most pickups are regularly scheduled however the group often gets calls from people holding weddings bar mitzvahs or festivals  knowing there will be leftover food at the end of the night then a call goes out to find a volunteer to help pickup and delivery the leftover food 
volunteer drivers make food deliveries every day of the year except christmas food pickups range in size  so people can pick them up no matter if they own a small sedan or a minivan that way volunteering is within the reach of everyone 
from the time a driver leaves home  stopping to pick up the food and drop it off at a partner agency  it usually takes no longer than  minutes for he or she to return home families volunteer 
quite often entire families will volunteer and work together for the weekly delivery service labriola says families volunteering are instrumental to educating younger generations about hunger and food waste 
for example around thanksgiving a family with two young children met labriola one day to pick up dozens of turkeys at a grocery store the children looked amazed as they helped carry the delivery  birdbybird  from the store to the truck and into the agency that would distribute them to families labriola told the kids they just helped feed  families the children soon realized what they did one of the children said thats as many kids that are in my school 
the exemplary work and dedication exhibited by volunteers in the metroatlanta georgia community is a truly successful model of how to eliminate food waste and hunger perhaps more community groups organizations local businesses and volunteers will consider following their worthy example you might also like",0

call captains will sign up to be responsible for an entire talk radio program or programs between now and the election to  help recruit callers to call in and promote donald trumps campaign throughout the program for that day  remind trump talk radio blitz callers who have sign up of their commitment to call into the show  help ensure your trump talk radio blitz callers are prepared to discuss the shows topics  monitor the show and the discussions and  report your successes back to the campaign 
paid for by the trump campaign 
i mean its working so well for the trump spokespeople especially those propaganda artists embedded on a certain cable network why not organize nonprofessionals to give the same talking points and disseminate them in a way that appears organic lol i kid if youve run into these people in a comment section or forums you know they have the campaign message down so exactly as to be a screaming siren of talking points 
so when you hear screaming tinfoil about fake polls and accusations that hillary clinton committed treason even though she was actually cleared you neednt worry that your entire country has gone insane 
this is the last gasp of a sinking campaign trying to fool the voters with media propaganda dished out by volunteers",1

the results of the  election have left many women frightened for their futures in this country but yearold vanessa carp realizes that times of great upheaval call for decisive action after realizing how dire the coming years could be for her this quickthinking young woman is scrambling to experience as much human dignity as possible before donald trump sets foot in the white house 
wow major props to vanessa for getting herself prepared 
with just a few short months before the presidentelect comes to power vanessa has been taking herself out into the world every single day and soaking up as much human dignity as time permits whether shes at home at work running errands or even at the gym vanessa is seizing every chance to feel like a respected autonomous human being before it all gets taken away from her on january  
she now basks in the joy of visiting her doctor unencumbered by the decisions others will soon make on her behalf she relishes every interaction with her male coworkers while she still gets to feel like their peer and she loves taking daily jogs around her neighborhood savoring every last minute of the relative safety she temporarily still feels 
its getting down to the wire but im just focused on hoarding as many normal human experiences as i can noted vanessa standing in the middle of her local grocery store and reveling in the feeling of having most of her civil rights intact i dont know how many moments like these ill get to have so i figure i should stockpile some for the next four to eight years before its too late 
smart move vanessa 
its unfortunate that women even have to think about things like this in  but we commend vanessa for taking necessary precautions ladies lets all learn a lesson from vanessa if youd like to experience a little human dignity before trump is in the oval office now is the time to do it",0

as a parent you always have to be aware of what lessons your child is learning from the world around him or her i know that i wont be able to protect my yearold james from every bad thing out there but on a recent trip to the grocery store i was utterly appalled by a disturbing trend our country has become desensitized to violence in hotsauce names and its a big problem 
you cant walk down your grocers sauce isle without being bombarded by hotsauce names that romanticize violence tears of blood nuclear bombardment chile extract and death on the toilet have become standard fare in the hotsauce industry an innocent trip to purchase a simple bottle of ketchup now subliminally exposes shoppers and our impressionable children to dozens of gruesome descriptions of burning flesh brutal deaths and massive ass damage 
as soon as the hotsauce industry agreed it was okay to allow names like cremation in a bottle pepper sauce and ass grave cajun sauce to appear on store shelves any shred of decency went out the window an arms race began to see who could come up with the most violent and gory sauce name society be damned and it needs to stop before our children internalize these sorts of brutal names as the norm for hotsauce labels 
hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today 
i took my son james to my favorite mexican restaurant this past weekend and he didnt even blink when he saw a bottle with volcanic crucification written out in flames if he isnt bothered by this whos to say if he would even think twice if he one day saw a hot sauce called ghost pepper throat thresher 
i pray that we correct course in this country before anyone decides to make that hot sauce 
it wasnt always like this hot sauce has always been hot but the names used to imply the hotness without going into the graphic detail you see today names like franks red hot let you know you were in for some serious heat but left something to the imagination but there is no longer a moral standard for hotsauce names now all it takes to begin leading a child down a bad path is for them to glance at a sauce bottle in a friends refrigerator door 
whether its screaming suicide moruga scorpion sauce or habanero holocaust sauce the lengths to which todays sauces are going to outdo one another with disturbingly violent names has gotten out of control and if youre a parent you know that we must do something to stop this before its too late for our children",0
"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

" reminders to ignore the trump is doomed polls   
weve recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the trump is doomed polling saga a few days ago the media was loudly trumpeting that hillarys victory was inevitable that the polls were in and she was going to ignore trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races and then just like last time around the numbers turned around again 
i was recently asked to predict the race i answered that the one thing i could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for hillary right before the election that much is very likely 
its in the medias interest to spread fud by promoting polls that predict not just a hillary win but a landslide creating the perception that voting is useless the more republicans feel that the outcome is futile the less likely they will be to go out and vote but the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding this remains a challenging and very unusual election 
the premature panic weve seen in some circles is unhealthy we shouldnt completely ignore poll numbers but neither should we treat them as inevitable 
weve had two major lessons in why thats short sighted",1

"the splcs libelous new report on antimuslim extremists equating counterjihadists with jihadists robert spencer 
the objective of this libelous new report from the hardleft moneymaking and incitement machine the southern poverty law center splc is made plain within it before you book a spokesperson from an antimuslim extremist group or quote them in a story research their background  detailed in this indepth guide to  of the most visible antimuslim activists and consider the consequences of giving them a platform 
they wish to silence those who speak honestly about the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat blaming us for a supposed rise in islamophobia if they really want to stamp out suspicion of islam of course they will move against not us but the likes of omar mateen syed rizwan farook tashfeen malik nidal malik hasan mohammed abdulazeez dzhokhar tsarnaev and the myriad other muslims who commit violence in the name of islam and justify it by reference to islamic teachings 
the splc doesnt do that because its objective is not really to stop islamophobia at all but to create the illusion of a powerful and moneyed network of islamophobes who can only be stopped if you write a check to the splc thats what this is really all about 
in constructing this illusory edifice the splc labels me and fourteen others antimuslim extremists we are of course no more antimuslim than foes of the nazis were antigerman but note the word extremists thats the mainstream media and obama administrations term of choice for jihad terrorists in what way are we extremists has anyone on the splcs hit list and given the splcs track record of inciting violence against its targets that is exactly what it is ever blown anything or anyone up beheaded anyone boasted of our imminent conquest of any territory and the massacre of or enslavement of its people no all we have done is speak critically about jihad terror and sharia oppression the splc is trying to further the libel that we are the other side of the coin the nonmuslim bin ladens and awlakis until we commit any terror attacks or conspire with others to do so however the splcs libel is only that a libel 
its also passingly ironic that the splc list includes several people who are doubtless horrified to be in this company as they have endeavored for years to distinguish their message from that of those whom they themselves would smear as islamophobes but their temporizing and pandering didnt work they ended up on the index of prohibited thinkers anyway as will ultimately anyone who dares to note that islam just might have something to do with the acts of murder committed in its name and in accord with its teachings 
the report as a whole stands as an example of the lefts strange tendency to present true statements as if they were selfevidently false without bothering to explain why apparently the splc knows its supporters and is aware that it doesnt need to bother with troublesome things like you know facts 
the splcs hit list recurrently excoriates people for making true statements that it apparently regards as selfevidently false for example it says that ann corcoran of refugee resettlement watch accuses immigrantrun stores of illegally trafficking in food stamps this is a case that corcoran makes with evidence  evidence that the splc doesnt bother to try disproving it says that steven emerson of the investigative project on terrorism has claimed that the obama administration extensively collaborates with the muslim brotherhood that he actually has done so doesnt seem to bother them as andrew c mccarthy has noted  barack obama has spent his presidency cultivating islamists particularly from the international muslim brotherhood and its affiliates in the united states the splc also hits emerison for having asserted that europe is riddled with nogo zones regarding nogo zones here are some news articles from just the past few weeks 
germany police sick of citizens nogo zone fears 
the splc excoriates brigitte gabriel of act for america for saying that any practicing muslim who believes the word of the koran to be the word of allah  who goes to mosque and prays every friday who prays five times a day  this practicing muslim who believes in the teachings of the koran cannot be a loyal citizen of the united states yet it says nothing of course about the many teachings of the quran that contradict american constitutional principles the denial of the freedom of speech the death penalty for apostasy the devaluation of women and more how to reconcile these teachings with us citizenship the splc did not bother to explain 
the splc quotes david horowitz saying there are only a couple of degrees of separation between anybody on the left and the terrorists  and that includes people in the democratic party even those who are antiterrorist here again no refutation is offered  yet the lefts dalliance with palestinian jihad groups and overall antiamericanism make it impossible to dismiss horowitzs assertion 
frank gaffney of the center for security policy were told is gripped by paranoid fantasies about muslims destroying the west from within the splc doesnt bother to mention the explanatory memorandum on the general strategic goal for the brotherhood in north america  the captured muslim brotherhood internal document that explained that brotherhood members must understand that their work in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions 
in attacking pamela geller of the american freedom defense initiative the splc descended to outright fabrications notes geller  their claim that i insist that obama is the love child of malcolm x is patently untrue the splc also states that i have spoken to a neofascist group in germany when in fact i have never even been to germany it characterizes former fbi agent john guandolos claim that cia director john brennan was a convert to islam as an outlandish accusation when in fact a us asset assigned overseas with brennan in saudi arabia when he was station chief confirmed years ago their firsthand account that brennan was indeed the target of a saudi intelligence influence operation that led to his conversion brennan has also stated publicly that he visited mecca which is impossible for a nonmuslim to do unless he is a special guest of the saudi king 
even more strangely the splc targets ayaan hirsi ali a woman who grew up as a muslim in somalia suffered genital mutilated at the hands of muslims is under death threats from muslims and lives in exile from her homeland because of muslims instead of trying to discredit her the splc should be honoring her for her stand for human rights against sharia oppression but the splc has other priorities 
of me the splc concedes that i am a real intellectual but complains that i am entirely selftaught in the study of islam an odd objection one cannot be both selftaught and a real intellectual in any case its false i am indeed mostly selftaught in the study of islam and make no secret of or apologies for it every days headlines proves me correct nonetheless the fact is that i did first read the quran and began studying islam in earnest while at the university of north carolina my claims says the splc are provably false but then only offers a number of them that are demonstrably true without any attempt to refute them 
it even says that i have referred to barack obama as the first muslim president this one epitomizes the dishonesty of the splc the quote comes from an article i wrote in  discussing how obama was not a muslim stating that his obvious affinity for islam and the muslim world could make him into our first muslim president the way bill clinton was called our first black president after eight years of obama id say i was proven correct in rather spectacular fashion 
the splc finally hits me for having even suggested that the media may be getting money to depict muslims in a positive light 
the facts are once again deeply unfortunate for the splc george soros funded a report on islamophobia on twitter and gave  to the center for american progress for a defamatory report on alleged islamophobes he also spent  for favorable coverage of the muslim migrant inundation bought favorable coverage of the iran deal  and bought islamophobia propaganda after the san bernardino jihad massacre 
but what need does the splc have of facts it knows its readers wont check up on the veracity of its claims but will accept them at face value since the splc is of the camp of the saints the enlightened and tolerant left those who are outside that camp clearly have no rights that the splc feels bound to respect",1

amateur footage emerged on saturday showing what appears to be turkish soldiers executing two female pkk insurgents at pointblank range
almasdar news that released the footage says they are not able to independently verify it
a ceasefire between turkey and the pkk ended last year and clashes have since claimed hundreds of lives on both sides
the pkk operates primarily in the mountanious terrain of southeastern turkey and often uploads footage of its kurdish fighters ambushing turkish government troops
more  bombers stopped by police blew themselves up in turkey dispute over kurds and coup attempt threatens usturkey alliance the attempted coup détat made turkey band together erdogan vows heavy price for coup plotters the tension between kurdish fighters and turkish government have always been high in past years in yet one of the most recent cases a turkish court banned the coleader of turkeys prokurdish opposition from traveling abroad as part of a court case in which she has been accused of being a member of an armed terrorist group hurriyet daily reported on saturday reuters reported
figen yuksekdag cochair of peoples democratic party hdp is facing jail time up to  years over comments she made last year in the southeastern border town of suruc the prosecutor of the case requested the ban
hdp described the courts decision to bar yuksekdag from foreign travel as political and arbitrary saying in a statement that it will make a formal appeal for its overturn
the move comes days after the comayors of diyarbakir the largest city in the southeast were detained as part of a security crackdown turkeys largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a ceasefire between the state and the kurdistan workers party pkk last year
president tayyip erdogan has accused the hdp of being a political extension of the outlawed pkk and repeatedly called for the prosecution of its members he has also said the removal of elected officials and civil servants accused of links to the pkk was a vital part of the battle against it
several other hdp lawmakers including cochair selahattin demirtas are also being prosecuted largely over terrorism charges after the parliament earlier this year lifted the immunity of hdp deputies along with the immunity of mps from other parties
meanwhile three turkish soldiers were killed and five others were wounded by mortar fire from pkk militants near the southeastern town of cukurca security sources said
soldiers who were on an operation in cukurca in hakkari province bordering iraq and iraq returned the fire sources said operations were under way to hunt down the militants
the autonomyseeking pkk took up arms in  and more than  people have died in the conflict it is considered a terrorist group by turkey the united states and the european union",0
"posted on october   by davidswanson 
picture if you will video footage of vintage early  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs 
thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  
the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about 
id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence 
still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition 
one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today 
but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war 
and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin 
stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other 
stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government 
the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers 
stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it 
stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored

microsoft cofounder bill gates having a net worth of  billion and amazoncom ceo jeff bezos having a net worth of  billion are the nations two richest men they are at the top of the forbes  list of americas superrich individuals people who have net worths of billions of dollars many see the rich as a danger new york times columnist bob herbert wrote it doesnt really matter what ordinary people want the wealthy call the tune and the politicians dance his colleague paul krugman wrote on paper were a onepersononevote nation in reality were more than a bit of an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy people dominate its sentiments like these that have led me to wish there were a humane way to get rid of the rich for without having the rich around to be whipping boys and distract our attention we might be able to concentrate on whats best for the  percent of the rest of us 
lets look at the power of the rich with all the money that gates bezos and other superrich people have what can they force you or me to do can they condemn our houses to create space so that another individual can build an auto dealership or a casino parking lot can they force us to pay money into the governmentrun  and doomed  obamacare program can they force us to bus our children to schools out of our neighborhood in the name of diversity can they force us to buy our sugar from a highcost domestic producer rather than from a lowcost caribbean producer the answer to all of these questions is a big fat no 
you say williams i dont understand let me be more explicit bill gates cannot order you to enroll your child in another school in order to promote racial diversity he has no power to condemn your house to make way for a casino parking lot unless our elected public officials grant them the power to rip us off rich people have little power to force us to do anything a lowly municipal clerk earning  a year has far more lifeanddeath power over us it is that type of person to whom we must turn for permission to build a house ply a trade open a restaurant and do myriad other activities its government people not rich people who have the power to coerce us and rip us off they have the power to make our lives miserable if we disobey this coercive power goes a long way toward explaining legalized political corruption 
take just one of thousands of examples the fanjuls are among the biggest sugar cane growers and they coown the worlds largest refining company american sugar refining which markets its product under the brand names domino ch redpath tate  lyle and florida crystals during the  election cycle florida crystals contributed more than  to candidates and political spending groups it spent more than  million lobbying congress the us departments of agriculture and commerce and the office of the us trade representative heres my question to you do you think it forked over all that money to help our elected representatives uphold and defend the us constitution nonsense the fanjuls and other sugar producers want congress to use tariffs to keep foreignproduced sugar out of our country so they can reap the financial benefits from being able to charge americans two to three times the world price of sugar 
so heres the ultimate question if some rich people can line the pockets of politicians to do their bidding at the expense of the rest of us whos to blame i think its we the people who are to blame for not using our votes to run such politicians out of town  and thats most of them but that might be deceitful of us for we also ask politicians to enable us to live at the expense of others",1

"there are some things that we have learned about the united states from this election well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society
the federal government has been corrupted probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe democrats the best example of this was the behavior of fbi director james comey the fbi is part of the executive branch of government so comey reports to loretta lynch who in turn reports to obama despite this fact one expects that the fbi be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to after all the us was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law
comeys actions reveal that the fbi has thrown equality before the law out the window at first the fbi investigated clintons use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was secretary of state but even though clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences comey exonerated her back in july with a hand slap
in a move that surprised everyone comey reopened on october th the criminal investigation of clinton after  emails state department emails were found on pervert anthony weiners computer trump supporters rejoiced and hillary supporters expressed outrage but the white house calmly called comey a man of integrity did they know something we didnt
it turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just  hours before election day comey exonerated clinton again  the fbi director likely intended to clear clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse donald trumps criticism of her
the big lesson is that the law is applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed
the elites are in control but elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the great oz
ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees by controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle the good news is that their control is not complete they are not omnipotent
the weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways the first was with the brexit vote when prime minister david cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the uks membership in the eu he never dreamed that britons would actually vote to leave all the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames still through the work of men like nigel farage and boris johnson the british populace voted to leave the eu the brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win
the second way was the campaign of trump himself the gop had planned a coronation for jeb bush the rest of the gop field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from jeb trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed jeb and the rest of the little jebs the elite plan to have hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by trumps campaign even if trump has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the great oz we see the globalists behind the curtain
the third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the alt right a tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the us now we have grandmothers in texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists
the overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite they exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us with sound strategy they can be defeated
the elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites 
in the past europe had an aristocracy this aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country the aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war they also had the same religion as the rest of the country we already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to wikileaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion
wikileaks revealed that hillary clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with marina abramovic a serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated it also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain
while spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the us globalist elite hillary clinton john podesta jayz and beyonce lady gaga and gwen stefani have all attended these rituals and i would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians ceos and bankers also participate getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the us there are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day european elites
there are several things at work here most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual it is more like a college fraternity initiation it only means something in terms of ones social standing also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses
in both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us they dont share the same destiny as us if the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused and they even lack a common morality with us in their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us
the fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them the aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen the modern elite lack this wisdom once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal
conclusion with trumps election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated however the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning in any case we can be grateful that the election of  has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society

"one twitter user once asked me is it too much to hope that one of our parties would pick someone with no links to a pedophile sexslave island 
apparently it is too much to ask for 
both presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump and former president bill clinton have ties to convicted pedophile and democratic donor billionaire jeffery epstein and sex slave island 
note president bill clinton is not merely the husband of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton either bill is currently campaigning for his wife plus hillary recently unveiled that bill with be in charge of  revitalizing the economy  if she were to take office 
it has been uncovered that clinton known for his troublemaking libido has even stronger ties to epstein than previously reported as noted by the free beacon  clinton was aboard the infamous lolita express owned by a billionaire pedophile at least  times not the initially reported  times 
fox news reports  
clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing  on  occasions has been reported but flight logs show the number is more than double that and trips between  and  included extended junkets around the world with epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names including tatiana the trickedout jet earned its nabakovinspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girlsofficial flight logs filed with the federal aviation administration show clinton traveled on some of the trips with as many as  us secret service agents however on a fiveleg asia trip between may  and may   not a single secret service agent is listed 
the republican presumptive nominee apparently got in on the action too trumps ties to epstein  a man trump once called a terrific guy  and sex slave island have been chronicled by the daily wire here  
per the political insider trump is accused of threatening and raping a yearold girl on the private island  epstein is also named in the suit for sexual misconduct the lawsuit accusations have been vehemently denied by the trump camp alleging that the filing is a hoax and that there is no evidence that the plaintiff in question actually exists 
sex slave island sometimes referred to as orgy island both lovely names is one deranged place allegedly rife with solicited sex often from minors  groomed  by epstein 
terrific guy epstein of course was convicted for soliciting sex from a minor in  the billionaire served  months in prison

"with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up former charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist as you would expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth
seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women 
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson

excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification  sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer  but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography  she may not be bad for a gal nearing  but her best years are a good  years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit  and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in  is nothing short of a joke
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them
its not just famous people natasha devon
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in  in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls
as she hurtled towards  natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in  frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive
devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism
when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant

"every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women 
the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw 
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump
donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it
approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug

from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space
human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing

now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness
conclusion we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next

"chinese immigrants demand protection from paris muggers david chazan telegraph august   
thousands of angry chinese immigrants demonstrated in a paris suburb yesterday sun to demand police protection from muggers who they say prey on them because they are seen as easy targets 
the death of a yearold chinese tailor after being badly beaten in a robbery earlier this month has lent new urgency to the long running complaint that asian immigrants are systematically attacked and robbed in the french capital 
the chinese community is dying in silence read a slogan on a tshirt splashed with red to symbolise bloodstains worn by one demonstrator maike song 
he said he joined the protest in aubervilliers to pay homage to chaoling zhang the father of two who died on august  after being punched to ground in the northeastern suburb that is home to some  chinese immigrants 
no arrests have been made over the attack 
about  chinese residents of aubervilliers have been attacked and robbed since november according to the francochinese friendship association 
it is because of prejudices that chinese people are weak docile and wealthy said fang a young female student ive been attacked three times in three years and my friends are suffering the same thing some have moved away from this area because of it i dont go out with a handbag any more 
community workers say many muggings are committed by members of other minorities living in the area generally of arab or african origin 
paris officials corroborated the figures but declined to identify the robbers by ethnic origin

last night a leaked memo was revealed indicating fbi director james comeys stated reasons for reopening the clinton email probe upon discovering what now appear to be tens of thousands of huma abedin emails located on anthony weiners notebook comey revealed two core reasons for the action a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup what he did not reveal and as has emerged overnight from a report by the new yorkers jane mayer is that comey also acted in contravention to doj practices and more importantly acted contrary to the preference of doj head loretta lynch whose infamous meeting with bill clinton on the phoenix tarmac at the end of june will likely be reassessed in light of these latest revelations 


according to the new yorker comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
traditionally the justice department has advised prosecutors and law enforcement to avoid any appearance of meddling in the outcome of elections even if it means holding off on pressing cases  one former senior official recalled that janet reno the attorney general under bill clinton completely shut down the prosecution of a politically sensitive criminal target prior to an election  she was adamantanything that could influence the election had to go dark the former official said please go to zero hedge to read the entire article",0

new york city new york  donald j trump the republican nominee for president has closed the gap with his democratic opponent hillary rodham clinton with just a couple weeks left in the election the latest national breitbart news networkgravis marketing poll shows 
clinton at  percent leads trump at  percent by just one pointinside the surveys  percent margin of error libertarian gary johnson gets just  percent and the green partys dr jill stein just  percent while  percent are unsure the survey was conducted from oct  to oct  sampling  registered voters across the united states the poll was conducted using a combination of interactive voice response polling and an internet panel of cell phone users 
something has happened since the third debate doug kaplan the managing partner of gravis marketing said of the poll conventional wisdom was after trump said he wouldnt promise to accept the results of the election and made the nasty woman comment many thought hillary would gainbut trump seems to be closing the gap in every election in the last  years this happens where the person behind closes the gap hillary still has a clear electoral advantage and many paths to victory however trump is not out of it but hillary is still the favorite 
this is a big story because it shows trump really closing importantly as the other close polls are showing democratic pollster pat caddell who worked for president jimmy carter and is working with breitbart news and gravis marketing on these polls added he is closing with his favorability and unfavorability as well 
caddell said he thinks obamacares failures where premiums are skyrocketing is one of many reasons why trump is surging among other things that is contributing to trumps rise in the polls caddell said when we are looking down the road at other things that may be influential we are seeing the possibility of again on the immigration issuethat thing about concern on the border seems to be increasing as is opposition to hillary and their plans to expand immigration and refugees which is another big issue but more importantly at the end of the survey we see both candidates have problems on their ability to unite the country and on whether or not they can have the moral leadership to lead theyre basically about the same which i consider a real improvement for trump now that hes that close",0

"if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students  shares
   
dr anthony jhall is a professor of globalization studies at the in alberta canada professor hall is the editorinchief of the american herald tribune he is author of several books including a twovolume publishing project at mcgillqueens university press entitled the bowl with one spoon american empire and the fourth world the bowl with one spoon part i mcgillqueens native and northern earth into property colonization decolonization and capitalism the bowl with one spoon part ii mcgillqueens native and northern series the part ii edition was recently selected by the uk independent as one of the best books of  the journal of the american library association called earth into property a scholarly tour de force the books aim to set the  catastrophe and post  wars in the context of global history since  dr hall has been suspended and harshly pulled from his classroom in midterm without any process of arbitration namely for having expressed his viewpoints on israeli crimes calling for an open debate on the holocaust and  despite being promoted to a full professor rank through a process of peer review in an exclusive interview with khameneiir professor hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the west
ayatollah khamenei has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual atmosphere there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive it
i reflected very selfconsciously on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country canada when i opted in the mid to late s to go to graduate school at the university of toronto with the great canadian historian jms careless as my phd supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of canada my course of study took me in  to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of sudbury the university of sudbury was in those years a jesuitrun entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular laurentian university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment there
for the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in sudbury and then in lethbridge alberta beginning in  at the invitation of the leroy little bear the chair of the department of native american studies i thus moved to the resourcerich province of alberta once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western canada
in my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first nationsfirst ministers conferences that took place in ottawa between  and  the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the phrase  the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of canada are hereby recognized and affirmed section  constitution act  
more the bnai brith and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in canadian universities creating an antimuslim bias at a canadian university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section  was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over canadas constitutional structure from the british imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of canadian federalism
the culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a madeincanada version of the canadian constitution involved my opposition between  and  to what became known as the meech lake accord if this political deal between canadas first ministers had become constitutional law the first nations of canada would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of canadas fundamental characteristic
in academic essays in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative committees i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the meech lake accord for fairminded canadians supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an ojicree parliamentarian by the name of elijah harper used his veto power in the manitoba legislature to block the ratification of the meech lake accord because of elijah harpers actions the meech lake accord did not become part of canadas supreme law
i was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of canada until about the year  between  and  i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native american studies towards a field of my own making globalization studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on globalization studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from  until the present
it is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished student joshua blakeney that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of palestinian and other arab peoples in the region of greater israel eretz israel it was joshua who also led me to my first interactions with iranian journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of  as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on me
due to the intervention of my colleague the mohawk activist splitting the sky i also began to see the events of  as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the twentyfirst century
my quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in  after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty member i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of action
i have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that canada is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual freedom of our universities if academic freedom is not to be respected in institutions of supposedly higher learning then there can be no basis for freedom of speech in environments not subject to the protections of tenure
the first to suffer the crackdown in universities will be our students they will have to deal with the fact that the treatment visited on me indicates it has become dangerous to ask pointed questions which might produce answers embarrassing to power our country canada cannot progress to higher levels of discourse and achievement under these repressive conditions
ayatollah khamenei believes exchanging viewpoints and opinions are in the nature of academic work how is this principle practiced at lethbridge university
i agree that exchanging viewpoints and opinions is a central aspect of academic work within universities and between universities i found that there was a good deal of openness to the exchange of information and ideas with colleagues media and public officials in the years between  and  when the core of my academic work revolved around the history of canadafirst nations relations
unfortunately i would have to say that the obstacles to the exchange of information and ideas began to mount significantly after  when i began to question the official narrative of what happened on  who really did what to whom during the initiating events of what soon became known as the global war on terror as i began to become skeptical of the official narrative i noticed more and more inclination on the part of colleagues to distance themselves from the subjects that captured my professional interest to put it bluntly i suppose it became clear to me that for a number of reasons it was not a good career move for younger colleagues to show interest in the subject of  specifically and false flag terrorism more generally
as i began to look more deeply into the existing research on  i was simultaneously drawn to the subject of war crimes and international law my collaboration with splitting the sky became more intense when we went to work to organize in response to the decision of the former us president george w bush to give a talk in calgary in  as his first public engagement as theoretically a regular civilian citizen our collective action in calgary in the spring of  led to a trial that we dubbed splitting the sky versus george w bush  although i had not yet associated the lies and crimes of  with israel first protagonists i ran into my first zionist pushback for my  studies when i presented my essay should george w bush be arrested in calgary alberta to be tried for international crimes i originally presented the paper at an invited talk at the university of winnipeg
my essay eventually ended up as an exhibit in the litigation that we referred to as splitting the sky versus george w bush  our stance was that the former us president should have been arrested in canada for being a crediblyaccused war criminal we were far from alone in bringing forward evidence that bush had violated many international covenants and conventions against for instance prohibited torture not only had he arguably violated international law but it seemed the former us president had violated canadas own crimes against humanity and war crimes act  the legislation had passed through parliament with the view that canada should not become a haven for war criminals
in pursuing this line of analysis i faced my first allegations that somehow my academic inquiry was antisemitic
as i worked on this subject one that i integrated into my pedagogy it became clear to me that we have never seen anything but victors justice when it comes to the enforcement of international law against those that commit war crimes crimes against humanity crimes against the peace and crimes against democracy it seems that only those on the losing side of military conflicts are ever brought to justice those on the winning side the stronger side are invariably held to be above the law
this line of scholarly investigation did result in various channels of academic exchange opening up for me with colleagues in my own university and other universities the most fruitful collaboration to develop however was that with dr kevin barrett who had lost his academic position at the university of wisconsin for incorporating related subjects into his research and pedagogy
for sure i should not be made to feel so alone in the academy when it comes to the study of  the most transformative event of the twentyfirst century in my view the academic institutions in north america and europe have failed abysmally in the study of false flag terrorism starting with the events of  i am particularly appalled by how this failure on the part of our institutions of higher learning has contributed to the rise of islamophobia as the necessary psychological condition giving license to those promoting the invasions of muslimmajority countries
in a meeting with president rouhani and his cabinet the leader of the islamic revolution said when it comes to caricatures insulting the sanctities of islam the west suddenly becomes an advocates of freedom and the freedom of expression however when it comes to the holocaust there is no freedom of expression why do you think we witness such double standards
a gross display of double standards plagues the ethnocentric way freedom is being defined in the socalled west the psychological operations attending the we are charlie hebdo ceremonies on paris in early  epitomized the hypocrisy the whole essence of this strange event in the city of lights seemed to signal that freedom of speech and expression in the west is virtually limitless when it comes to demeaning through cartoons of prophet mohammed as well as other sacred symbols of islamic religion the other side of the same coin are the many prohibitions imposed on for instance the french comedian mbala mbala dieudonné dieudonné was barred from entering canada for his efforts to make humor of the paranoid state of affairs attending any public references to jews jewish institutions or the activities of israel these days
one of my discoveries through this period of crisis is the fact that the thought police agents in the bnai brith equate my call for open debate on the holocaust and indeed open debate on all subjects as the equivalent of socalled holocaust denial how many of my colleagues at the and in other universities have bent before the harsh intimidation how many have made themselves proponents of shutting down open debate and allowing censorship from outside the academy to regulate our research teaching and publication
there is a controversial quote from ayatollah khamenei in which he says may god curse all those who put an end to political thoughts work and endeavor in universities whats your take on that how essential do you think such a perspective is for the academia
i agree wholeheartedly with the supreme leaders observation one of the great gifts of the creator to humans is the gift of reason and rationality our application of reason and rationality to our understanding of society will inevitably contribute to political thought work and endeavor
this type of applied reason should be especially vital in the work of universities where the highest level of political conception should be able to find expression elaboration and receptiveness indeed we need to make ourselves expert in universities at making safe places for the development of political discourse god curse us in the universities if we cannot be the home for vibrant political discourse",0

whats wrong with hillary why do everybody hate her dice asks the first woman who replies because shes a criminal

a few more ladies tell mark that hillary is a liar shes terrible with one woman adding she lost to obama eight years ago so why is she still running its kind of absurd to me

national review  what was the legal rationale under which hillary clinton quite intentionally shared classified information with her lawyers including david kendall cheryl mills and heather samuelson 
as i outlined in last weekends column we know that clintons emails were replete with classified information according to the fbi the classified emails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level eight topsecret emails and seven designated as special access program sap information while fbi director james comeys presentation understandably left this vague the likelihood is that seven of the eight topsecret emails are sap under president bill clintons  executive order topsecret intelligence is information the mishandling of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security the sap designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligencegathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources 
that is why access to this information is so tightly restricted and its unauthorized disclosure is routinely prosecuted",0

"the washington post reported donald trumps hiring of pollster tony fabrizio in may was viewed as a sign that the real estate mogul was finally bringing seasoned operatives into his insurgent operation 
but the republican presidential nominee appears to have taken issue with some of the services provided by the veteran gop strategist who has advised candidates from  gop nominee bob dole to florida gov rick scott the trump campaigns latest federal election commission report shows that it is disputing nearly  that fabrizios firm says it is still owed for polling 
trumps decision not to pay his pollster is the first of this type of story but given trumps history of not paying for services performed it wont be the last it is astonishing that the party of supposed fiscal responsibility and conservativism would put someone forward as their presidential nominee who has made a career out of running up debt for personal gain 
donald trumps mentality has always been to put himself first paying his debts never seems to have been a top priority for trump his businesses have been stiffing vendors and contractors for decades so it isnt surprising that he would bring this same mentality to the presidential campaign 
anybody who works for the trump campaign would be smart to get paid up front because donald trumps version of making america great involves taking your money and putting it in his own pocket

"democratic congressman threatens violence if gop tries to defund planned parenthood by hank berrien november   
the democratic congressman who is challenging house minority leader nancy pelosi ohio rep tim ryan threatened a youngstown street fight if donald trump attempts to defund planned parenthood 
speaking with jake tapper on cnns state of the union on sunday ryan intimated that defunding planned parenthood wasnt the only stimulus he would need to launch violence he stated if he tries to defund planned parenthood if he tries to kick people off their health insurance if they try to privatize medicare or cut taxes for the wealthy you know we are going to have a youngstown street fight in the capitol 
youngstown has been plagued by violent street fights in the recent past last may and august violence erupted on the streets of the city 
ryan called trumps infrastructure plan a bunch of smoke and mirrors he added that he didnt blame pelosi for focusing any specific economic issues i cant in good conscience hang this election around nancy pelosis neck of course but moving forward we have to win congressional seats in areas of the country that voted for donald trump even in my district where they voted for me and they voted for donald trump 
ryans campaign to replace pelsoi is picking up steam on sunday new york rep kathleen rice endorsed him stating he has a lot of good ideas but maybe most importantly he also isnt suggesting he has all the answers  he has stressed that he wants these conversations to be ongoing that he wants more voices in the conversation so that we can work together to craft our message and forge a winning strategy rice said in a statement

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one 
but very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later 
in this photo congressman albert thomas winks back at the brandnew president",1

the person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the white house it may well be donald j trump but further due diligence is required to ensure that american democracy is not threatened 
st century wire says 
although the election was called on nov th the democratic partys ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming president is still ongoing 
for those of us with long enough memories the democratic party their media operatives and the clinton campaign were claiming that trump and the gop would be engaged in this very same behavior after hillary clinton won the presidency as expected 
notice how the shoe is now on the other foot 
its interesting reading past stories by news sources linked to the clinton campaign and john podesta as politico has who ran a feature on aug th entitled why the gop will never accept president hillary clinton which lays out the case of hillarys lock on the white house and how the evil republicans will not accept her eventual election victory 
will donald trump respect the peaceful transition of power howled cnns wolf blitzer in the runup to the election the question now is will the democrats respect the result and simply move on as they say 
of course we now know that journalists like wolf at cnn were getting their talking points directly the clinton campaign  
as it turns out the only thing illegitimate about the  election was the mainstream corporate media

a growing number of academics and activists are calling for us authorities to fully audit or recount the  presidential election vote in key battleground states in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers 
the loose coalition which is urging hillary clintons campaign to join its fight is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week according to two people involved 
the document which is currently  pages long focuses on concerns about the results in the states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin 
im interested in verifying the vote said dr barbara simons an adviser to the us election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting we need to have postelection ballot audits simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement 
a second group of analysts led by the national voting rights institute founder john bonifaz and professor alex halderman the director of the university of michigans center for computer security and society is also taking part in the push for a review and has been in contact with simons 
in a blogpost early on wednesday halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching 
unfortunately nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now in the next several days to petition for recounts he said 
the developments follow clintons surprise defeat to donald trump in the  november vote and come after us intelligence authorities released public assessments that russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from democratic officials before the election

"by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  
seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system 
now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis

in  senator joe biden who is now the vice president under barack obama introduced an amendment in the bill granting aid to russia making the aid conditional on the fact that russia could not sell cryogenic engines for indias space programme the clinton administration was hellbent on hurting the development of indias space and technology sectors and blocked the sale of cray supercomputers that had been approved under the ronald reagan administration india was also targeted for several economic sanctions and was threatened under what was called the super  clause of the american trade law
these economic sanctions were specifically borne out in the way mr clinton attacked the indian textile and carpet industries throughout the s the terms dunkel draft super  wto and patent laws became synonyms for the us attempts to retard the indian economy and led to many protests in india
by  india was justified in believing that indous relations had hit the lowest point but things took a dramatic turn for the worse during bill clintons second term in office madeleine albright became the new secretary of state and she was increasingly hostile to india especially through her pseudoracist television outbursts in fact she loved attacking india so much she went at it after leaving office and called for a plebiscite in kashmir justifying the actions of violent groups in the process
more clintons policies look like a death sentence for americans  things to expect with a hillary clinton presidency hillary clinton must be indicted how hillary clinton ushered in a one party dictatorship of monopoly capital remember this is the same bloodsoaked albright who advocated bombing yugoslavia and then got her investment firm to attempt a takeover of mines in that country like the clintons she also knows how to abuse her power lest we forget albright also justified the deaths of half a million iraqi children and claimed that the deaths were worth it and the icing on the cake for this particularly nasty woman albright has already threatened women in america and claimed that there was a special place in hell reserved for them if they did not vote for hillary clinton
there is already talk of joe biden in the frame as secretary of state under hillary clinton biden would continue his antiindia agenda and try to thwart the development of indias space programme and other technological advancements then of course there is hillarys closest confidante a duplicitous lady called huma abedin who is of pakistani descent and whose family has links to radical elements in pakistan and saudi arabia abedin could end up playing an important role in determining american foreign policy and would be certainly antimodi
another point against hillary clinton is that the hawkish henry kissinger has supports her and her oeuvre as secretary of state this is the same kissinger who is so hostile against india many of his racist statements are even on tape to that end
it is in the light of this setting that many indianamericans have opposed the candidacy of hillary clinton and have come out in support of donald trump in contrast to the policies of the clintons trump has promised to make india the best friend of the us and has stated that he looks forward to working with prime minister narendra modi trump has also reached out to hindus in us while there is always a risk of the unknown and it is not clear if trump can make the change he wants to a hillary presidency will certainly be a major step back for india
in order for india to build a constructive relationship with us it requires people in both countries to have good intentions it is clear that india cannot have a strong and forward looking relationship with the us if hillary clinton is running the corridors of power on the other hand donald trump has articulated the right intent and his stance holds promise for india",0

tom hayden the vietnam war protester and sds founder died this past weekend at age  
haydens journey was in many ways tragic born december  in the detroit suburbs he was not unlike many radical leaders a reddiaper baby his parents were irish catholics who named him after st thomas aquinas and sent him to catholic school his father was a marine who worked for chrysler and an abusive drunk haydens parents had a rocky marriage and divorced when he was a boy which affected him terribly haydens friend and exradical david horowitz observed that hayden harbored what irving howe once described as an obscure personal rage possibly from his estrangement from his father tom was indeed an angry man wrote horowitz who seemed in perpetual search of enemies 
hayden channeled that anger into a group that did much damage to america and was the antithesis of anything that thomas aquinas would have ever imagined sds students for a democratic society 
hayden will be forever young and forever a hippie in the memories of many americans the snarling activist who married hanoi jane fonda and literally wrote the script for sds hayden wrote sdss manifesto its founding port huron statement which haydens creampuff obituary in the washington post generously referred to as an expansive utopian manifesto that extolled participatory democracy as an antidote to the complacency and conformity of the eisenhower decade 
right 
haydens odd expressions of participatory democracy included another writing he scribbled an infamous june   letter wishing good fortune and victory to the north vietnamese colonels who were killing american boys in southeast asia  using the same kind of artillery that haydens sweetheart jane posed beside in her stint as a viet cong covergirl that was just one of countless disturbing actions by tom hayden at the time all of which todays leftists merrily sweep under the rug as they uphold him as a crusader for civil rights and of course social justice 
but not etched in our memory was what might have been tom haydens swan song long after his and his wifes cheerleading for the viet cong namely the document that he wrote for our president of fundamental transformation few know this but hayden was a founder of another group of destructive forces a group called progressives for obama 
the groups members came together in  coalescing around the only democratic presidential nominee in their lifetimes who was farleft enough for them to support they constituted a whos who of the s sds crowd among the nearly  formal signers to progressives for obama were mark rudd carl davidson jane fonda thorne dreyer daniel ellsberg richard flacks john mcauliff jay schaffner and more columbia university was naturally wellrepresented if not through the likes of rudd who shut down the campus in  then through current faculty such as todd gitlin a former sds president who today is professor of journalism sociology and chair of columbias doctoral program in communications 
whereas the likes of obama friends bill ayers and bernardine dohrn were thrust into the national spotlight in  by conservatives like glenn beck and sean hannity progressives for obama flew under the radar largely unnoticed even by the right 
appropriately spearheading progressives for obama was the man who had spearheaded sds tom hayden was one of the four initiators of progressives for obama along with barbara ehrenreich bill fletcher jr and danny glover 
it is no exaggeration to say that the signers list of progressives for obama resembled the roster of sdsers called to testify before congress in december  for their subversive activities aside from the likes of hayden rudd and davidson other sdsers among progressives for obama were bob pardun who was sds education secretary from  and paul buhle a professor who has recently sought to revive sds 
among these names from the insane s all were fired up in  over the unique opportunity that a fellow farleft radical one barack obama offered they saw obama as a golden chance a onceinalifetime moment and they got it on november   obama won the day and they at last won the day too 
and therein among the progressives for obama the testimony of leader tom hayden was especially revealing 
understand that after his early life establishing sds meeting with and expressing good fortune and victory to the viet cong and vigorously protesting the american system hayden went into politics professional activism and education like his erstwhile sds brethren hayden grasped the power of higher education which they have pervaded and served as a professor at pitzer college and also at obamas alma mater occidental college 
like mark rudd like bill ayers like bernardine dohrn all of them now in higher education hayden had come to view a quick revolution of the system as too daunting if not impossible he had become much more patient instead advocating a progressive evolution of slower measured change  by  he was seeking to advance the progressive cause within the established mainstream democratic party 
of course hayden once helped blow up the democratic partys national convention in  no matter the party of  was different and warmly accepted him 
hayden was ecstatic over barack obamas presidential campaign he jumped in with both feet looking to assist wherever he could with a rush of enthusiasm not seen since his days undermining america in vietnam not one to tinker around hayden got to work on a formal organization and unifying statement as he had done for sds  once again there at the creation the man who drafted sdss pivotal port huron statement got to work drafting mission statements for progressives for obama 
during the  campaign a touched hayden was moved to verse over the emergence of obama in one article titled obama and the open and unexpected future written for commondreamsorg selfdescribed as a website for breaking news  views for the progressive community hayden mused 
i didnt see him coming when i read of the young state senator with a background in community organizing who wanted to be president i was at least sentient enough to be interested when i read dreams of my father sic i was taken aback by its depth this young man apparently gave his first public speech against south african apartheid at an occidental college rally organized by students for economic democracy the student branch of the campaign for economic democracy which i chaired in  the buds of curiosity quickened 
hayden saw in obama a longawaited vehicle for economic democracy an instrument to channel an equal distribution of wealth  economic justice or redistributive change as obama himself had once put it hayden wished that win or lose the obama movement will shape progressive politics for a generation to come he also hoped that that progressive movement likewise might transform obama as well both could reinforce and shape one another 
hayden wrote that in june  when obama was elected later the following november hayden was beside himself with joy surely shocked that the american electorate had finally voted for a president that tom hayden saw as his kind of president once upon a time traditional democrats like haydens parents had shaken their heads in disgust at what tom and his pals did to their partys convention in chicago in  at what they did during the days of rage the next year at what they did at columbia during the student strike and on and on but now by  the democratic party was theirs it belonged to the s kiddies 
the former sds founder became particularly vocal in his praise for obama once the election was over during the election the goal was to organize raise money but not speak too loudly out of fear of driving away the moderates and remaining traditional democrat moms and pops who had worked in the mines and the mills who joined unions who clinged to their god and guns who prayed rosaries and filled churches who were prolife and antigay marriage with the presidency now secured hayden could open up joined by his former comrades at the takenoprisoners website of progressives for obama he began regularly sounding off against obamas critics  those opposing single payer or the public option in healthcare reform or government management of general motors  with the subtlety of a howitzer 
with the presidency won hayden and his allies were free to express themselves to demonize healthinsurance companies the financialservices industry aig the big three automakers or whatever other capitalist reptile lenins phrase stood in the way of president obamas desire for reform and mandate for change 
in the twoterm presidency of fundamental transformation under obama hayden and friends achieved many of their common dreams 
by this election cycle in  tom hayden must have been mesmerized by the revolution he and his fellow radicals had pulled off in the democratic party 
alas it was fitting that tom hayden became seriously ill his final stand during a turn for the worse at the democratic national convention in philadelphia this past summer where he was striving to ensure that the democratic party continue along the radical path of fundamental transformation that he and his allies had been unable to achieve via sds and the weather underground that path in the hands of hillary clinton is assured 
today at long last for tom hayden and friends the new democratic party and the new america is theirs he can rest in peace assured that his mission is finally being accomplished",1
"military an mq reaper remotely piloted aircraft flies by during a training mission november   at creech air force base in indian springs nevada photo by afp 
the us military forces have secretly been using an airbase in tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oilrich libya officials say 
the announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a washington post report on wednesday 
libya has been struggling to contain the daesh takfiri terrorists who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator muammar gaddafi in  
the base has apparently been in use since late june in an alleged effort to support the libyan governments fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of sirte 
the us has also been using bases in niger and djibouti but those ones are farther away 
efforts by the administration of president barack obama to access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small special operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a blind spot for us and western spy agencies 
the officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences adding they could be armed in the future if tunis agrees 
the tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report 
drones tasked with assassination in the north african country usually fly out of naval air station sigonella on the italian island of sicily 
the reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the obama administration efforts not to harm tunisias young democracy as put by the washington post  
washington conducts targeted killings through remotelycontrolled armed drones in several african and middle eastern countries 
the united states claims the airstrikes target members of alqaeda and other militants but according to local officials and witnesses civilians have been the victims of the attacks 
the airstrikes initiated by former us president george w bush have been escalated since barack obama took office in  
international organizations and human rights groups say the airstrikes flout international law loading",1

"when the river ran red arthur kemp american renaissance september  
the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost",0

as new revelations continue to unfold regarding hillary s time as secretary of state it has become clear that her state department was highly influenced by donors to the clinton foundation before hillary became secretary of state she had to sign an agreement with the obama administration restricting the ability of the clinton foundation to accept foreign donations in february of this year the clinton foundation admitted that the agreement had in fact been broken 
now it has been discovered that over half of nongovernment officials who met with hillary while she was secretary of state gave money to the clinton foundation what they received in return is just one of the questions hillary has refused to answer byavoiding the press for the past eight months in newly released emails there are details of donors being granted access to ambassadors due to their interest in the region the foundation putting pressure on hillary s staff to hire a former employee and the clinton global initiative leader demanding a top foundation donor be connected with the state department 
this is beyond the appearance of a conflict and americans have seen through the facade a majority of voters say they believe clinton gave special treatment to foundation donors while she was secretary of state as the president of judicial watch accurately pointed out there was no daylight between the two under mrs clinton and this was contrary to her promises 
after ignoring previous ethics guidelines the clintons are now trying to reassure americans by saying the foundation will change if hillary is elected the last ditch effort to gloss over ethics violations and possibly cover up corruption within hillary s state department is much too little and far too late americans are tired of being lied to by the clintons since the american people have a right to a full view of hillary s record before they head to the polls the clinton foundation should immediately release all of hillary s state department emails",0

"michael snyder 
i realize that this headline must sound extremely bizarre but in this article i will explain why this could actually happen we have just learned that the fbi has obtained a search warrant that will enable the agency to examine approximately  emails that are sitting on electronic devices owned by huma abedin and her estranged husband anthony weiner now that the fbi is going through these emails it is unlikely but still possible that a decision about whether or not to charge hillary clinton with a crime could be made by november th of course the most likely scenario is that hillary clinton will not be indicted before election day and that americans will be voting with this scandal hanging ominously over the clinton campaign but if the fbi does quickly take action it is possible that hillary clinton could be forced from the race before election day and that would require the democrats to come up with a new candidate 
in fact there are already calls in the mainstream media for clinton to willingly remove herself from the race for example the following comes from a chicago tribune article entitled  democrats should ask clinton to step aside  
so what should the democrats do now 
if ruling democrats hold themselves to the high moral standards they impose on the people they govern they would follow a simple process 
they would demand that mrs clinton step down immediately and let her vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine of virginia stand in her place 
democrats should say honestly that with a new criminal investigation going on into events around her homebrew email server from the time she was secretary of state having clinton anywhere near the white house is just not a good idea 
but what the author of that article does not understand is that tim kaine would not automatically take her place if clinton steps down before the election in a previous article  i included a quote from a us news  world report article that explained what would happen if hillary clinton was removed from the democratic ticket for some reason prior to november th 
if clinton were to fall off the ticket democratic national committee members would gather to vote on a replacement dnc members acted as superdelegates during this years primary and overwhelmingly backed clinton over boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders of vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says there currently are  committee members  a number that changes over time and is guided by the groups bylaws which give membership to specific officeholders and party leaders and hold  spots for selection by states along with an optional  slots dnc members can choose to fill 
but the party rules for replacing a presidential nominee merely specify that a majority of members must be present at a special meeting called by the committee chairman the meeting would follow procedures set by the dnc rules and bylaws committee and proxy voting would not be allowed 
so if this email scandal forced hillary clinton to exit the race at the last minute a majority of the members of the democratic national committee would gather to select a new nominee 
who would they choose 
lets take a look at the top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem to be an obvious choice since he is hillary clintons running mate but to win a national campaign you need to have name recognition and most americans outside of the state of virginia have very little familiarity with him 
and at this point he has proven to have very little popularity on the campaign trail in fact attendance at many of his rallies in key swing states can be measured in the dozens 
so to me it seems unlikely that the dnc would select kaine as the replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden has far more name recognition than tim kaine does and in recent days he has been touting how he believes that he would have actually won the nomination if he would have decided to run  
vice president joe biden said in a recent interview that he believed he could have beat former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic presidential nomination had he pursued it 
biden was asked in an interview with cnn saturday if news that the fbi was reopening their criminal probe into clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state made him secondguess his decision last year not to run 
but according to the vice president the short answer is no the only thing that kept him from running biden said was the recent death of his son beau 
unfortunately for biden he suffers from many of the same things that kaine does 
biden is boring he is not very good on the campaign trail and he doesnt have the sort of charisma that would motivate people to go to the polls in large numbers 
biden would probably represent the safest choice for the democrats but he might not be a winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem to be a logical choice since he was the runnerup to hillary clinton but the truth is that there are a lot of things working against bernie sanders 
first of all he does not have any real loyalty to the democrats he has previously operated as an independent and he expressed a desire to return to independent status once the campaign was over 
secondly the democratic establishment very much dislikes him and that plays a huge role in decisions such as this 
thirdly democratic insiders fear that he would be another mcgovern and would get absolutely wiped out in a general election 
so even though he is very popular with the radical left it appears that sanders would be the least likely choice on this list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would be very popular with the bernie sanders wing of the party and she would enable the party to replace hillary clinton with another woman 
so she is definitely a possibility 
but she does lack name recognition and just like sanders there would be concern that the republicans would frame her candidacy as another mcgovern because of her far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found that  percent of all democrats would rather have a third term for obama than a first term for hillary clinton 
and these days barack obamas approval rating is running anywhere from  to  
so the thought of another obama in the white house is not as farfetched as you might think 
michelle obama has better name recognition than anyone else on this list and she is generally very wellliked by the american people and she has received a tremendous amount of praise for her work on the campaign trail recently for instance her recent speech in new hampshire was lauded as the most influential speech of the  campaign in a recent msn article entitled  in this campaign michelle obama became more than just another political voice  
the speech amplified by timing and met with an enthusiastic response cemented obamas place as a star of the presidential race and put a defining stroke not just on how women view trump but also on herself as a voice of moral authority three months before leaving the white house she already is among the ranks of public figures who transcend politics and title 
when you rise to a level like that you see how much weight your words carry said anita mcbride former chief of staff to laura bush and executive in residence at the school of public affairs at american university we know she didnt like politics but she was impassioned by the language that was used and she feels compelled to speak out people listen to her 
if i were the democrats michelle obama is the one that i would select if a replacement nominee was needed because she would give them the very best chance of winning against donald trump 
of course the obamas are just as radical as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren but the american people have become quite comfortable with them at this point 
and i certainly hope that michelle obama does not become the nominee if hillary clinton has to step aside because donald trump would have an exceedingly difficult time defeating her 
in the final analysis none of this is probably going to matter anyway because it is unlikely that the fbi will move quickly enough to force hillary clinton out before election day but there is still a small chance that it could actually happen 
and if it does happen it is going to turn politics in america completely upside down

the cozy relationship with the clintons put the baltimorebased laureate at highprofile events with international players who could help it expand its reach around the globe 
the band memo also includes a section about forprofit activity of president clinton ie bill clinton inc 
some of the speeches secured by teneo include two  addresses delivered to ubs in  and  as well as a commitment for three additional paid speeches if he chose to give them 
another secured event was a  million fee for clinton to speak at two onehour sessions during an event in hong kong the fee included  for a private plane 
since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements the memo reads 
the relationship between band and the donors was criticized harshly by daughter chelsea clinton in another email 
chelsea specifically called out band and teneo for hustling business opportunities out of the foundation

thousands of britons have signed a petition to express their outrage over queen elizabeths use of  million in taxpayers money to repair the buckingham palace 
more than  people had signed the petition as of sunday two days after the government of prime minister theresa may allowed the royal family to repair the palace with public funds 
the uk parliament should discuss the petition when it hits the  mark 
on friday the chancellor of the exchequer philip hammond granted the yearold queen a percent rise in funding required for the palaces refurbishment over the next  years 
the money would be used to replace cables pipes and boilers installed  years ago to prevent a catastrophic event that might destroy the palace according to master of the queens household tony johnstoneburt 
petitioners argued that the royals should foot the massive bill themselves given the vast extent of their wealth 
the crown and its estates should be made to fund its own renovations wrote mark johnson who posted the petition 
protesters said the money could be used to mend the faltering national health service nhs or help families get more affordable homes amid a housing crisis britains queen elizabeth ii rides a carriage with colombias president juan manuel santos after the ceremonial welcome at horse guards parade in central london november   photo by afp 
it is wholly unreasonable to cut the benefits of the sick and disabled take away housing benefits from the poor and then pay for this said one signatory of the petition 
the antimonarchy campaign group republic also took issue with the announcement denouncing it as a disgrace 
whats worse is this appalling increase is only a small part of the annual cost of the royal family which we put at m said graham smith a member of the group 
over the past years the uk government has been generous towards the royal family despite cutting billions in public money 
under former treasury minister george osborne the queens sovereign grant for  was increased by  percent bringing the total to  million a year now the annual grant would be inflated by twothirds rising to  million in

britain is deploying troops aircraft and armor in the biggest military buildup in eastern europe since the cold war 
the deployment which was first floated in the press by uk defense chiefs on wednesday appears to have been prepared well in advance 
it will see up to  armored infantry troops deployed to estonia and royal air force raf fighter jets deployed to romania in what appears to be a reiteration of the strategy of containment employed against the soviet union during the cold war 
france and denmark will also commit more troops 
on wednesday uk defence secretary michael fallon struck a belligerent tone in the wall street journal when he warned that europe  is our continent  and as such would be defended 
while he claimed the force would be  defensive in nature  he pledged it would be  fully combatcapable  a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
he denied the placement of small formations around the baltic area are merely a  tripwire  in case of the muchheralded but hypothetical clash with russia 
 this is a serious military presence  he said 
tensions have only just begun to subside after a fleet of russian naval vessels bound for the mediterranean sea passed through the north sea and english channel 
the passage caused a press frenzy in the uk framed as though russia was launching an invasion of the british isles the royal navy deployed destroyers to in fallons words  manmark  the vessels while the raf overflew the ships with fighter jets 
according to the russian military the naval groups task was to  ensure a naval presence in operationally significant areas of the worlds oceans  as well as  the safety of maritime navigation and other maritime economic activities  of russia

posted on october   by paul joseph watson authorities claim its for security reasons towns across sweden have banned christmas street lights in the name of security but the real reason is almost certainly because the country has completely capitulated to islam after importing countless muslim migrants over the last two years according to an svt report the swedish transport administration trafikverket will not allow municipalities to erect christmas street lights on light poles that the authority manages meaning that many towns will have no festival lights at all on major streets according to speisa  the change is a victory for those who want to tone down the reminder of the countrys christian traditions but according to the swedish transport administration the decision for the drastic change is security poles are not designed for the weight of christmas lights and we have to remove anything that should not be there said eilin isaksson national coordinator at the swedish transport administration the argument that the lights are too heavy and pose a safety risk sounds like complete baloney swedes are being asked to believe that lights normally held up by tree branches are now too weighty to be supported by metal poles despite there being no safety issue with the street lights for decades this new rule has been instituted right after record numbers of muslim migrants flooded into the country  just a coincidence im sure in reality the christmas lights ban is almost certainly an effort to avoid offending muslim migrants who are causing chaos in cities like malmo  where the firebombing of cars and businesses in or near muslim ghetto nogo areas is becoming a routine occurrence as we previously reported  a top swedish bishop advocated removing crosses from a christian church and replacing them with islamic symbols in order to please muslims last christmas it was also announced that a christmas eve special broadcast on public television would be hosted by a muslim woman some areas of sweden are even capitulating to returning isis terrorists by offering jihadists free driving licenses and housing benefits to help them reintegrate into the job market,0

"schools all over america are closing on election day due to fears of violence all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything image credits flickr calibeach  
will this be the most chaotic election day in modern american history 
all across the nation schools are being closed on election day due to safety fears traditionally schools have been very popular as voting locations because they can accommodate a lot of people they usually have lots of parking and everyone in the community knows where they are and can usually get to them fairly easily but now there is a big movement to remove voting from schools or to shut schools down on election day so that children are not present when voting takes place according to fox news  voting has been removed or classes have been canceled on election day at schools in illinois maine nebraska new hampshire ohio pennsylvania wisconsin and elsewhere just a couple days ago  i shared with you a survey that found that  percent of all americans are concerned about violence happening on election day and all of these schools closing is just another sign of how on edge much of the population is as we approach november th 
many officials are being very honest about the fact that schools are being shut down on election day because they are afraid of election violence the following comes from fox news  
several schools across the nation have decided to close on election day over fears of possible violence in the hallways stemming from the fallout from the heated rhetoric that consumed the campaign trail 
the fear is the ugliness of the election season could escalate into confrontations and even violence in the school hallways endangering students 
if anybody can sit there and say they dont think this is a contentious election then they arent paying much attention ed tolan the falmouth maine police chief said tuesday his community has already called off classes on nov  and an increased police presence will be felt around town 
and without a doubt voting locations are soft targets that often have little or no security we have been blessed to have had such peaceful elections in the past but we also need to realize that times have changed i believe that there is wisdom in what georgia secretary of state brian kemp told reporters  
there is a concern just like at a concert sporting event or other public gathering that we didnt have  or  years ago said georgia secretary of state brian kemp cochairman of the national association of secretaries of state election committee  what if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something if that happens at a school then thats certainly concerning 
all it is going to take is a single incident to change everything 
let us hope that it is not this election day when we see something like that 
another reason why polling locations are under increased scrutiny this election season is because of concerns about election fraud this is something that donald trump has alluded to repeatedly on the campaign trail for instance just consider what he told a rally in pennsylvania  
we dont want to lose an election because you know what im talking about trump told an overwhelmingly white crowd in manheim pa earlier this month because you know what thats a big big problem and nobody wants to talk about it nobody has the guts to talk about it so go and watch these polling places  
and of course reports are already pouring in from around the country of big problems with the voting machines in illinois this week one candidate personally experienced a machine switching his votes from republicans to democrats 
early voting in illinois got off to a rocky start monday as votes being cast for republican candidates were transformed into votes for democrats 
republican state representative candidate jim moynihan went to vote monday at the schaumburg public library 
i tried to cast a vote for myself and instead it cast the vote for my opponent moynihan said you could imagine my surprise as the same thing happened with a number of races when i tried to vote for a republican and the machine registered a vote for a democrat 
in addition if you keep up with my work on the economic collapse blog  then you already know that a number of voters down in texas have reported that their votes were switched from donald trump to hillary clinton  
well it turns out that those voting machines appear to have a link to the clinton foundation  
according to opensecrets the company who provided the alleged glitching voting machines is a subsidiary of the mccarthy group 
the mccarthy group is a major donor to the clinton foundation  apparently donating  dollars in   when it was the largest owner of united states voting machines or perhaps the  dollars went to paying bill clinton for speeches 
either way it doesnt look good 
after everything that we saw in   i am convinced that there is good reason to be concerned about the integrity of our voting machines 
but democrats dont like poll observers because they think that having too many poll observers will intimidate their voters 
its unamerican but at the same time we have a long history of doing things like that  ari berman author of the  book  give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in america  previously told the christian science monitor voting was very very dangerous i dont think anyones suggesting that were at the same place today i just think the loss of the official poll observers is going to be really problematic 
without a doubt this has been the craziest election season that we have seen in decades and i have a feeling that it is about to get even crazier 
but will the end result be the election of the most corrupt politician in the history of our country  
if that is the outcome after all that we have been through it will be exceedingly depressing indeed newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles",0

"politics iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif attends a news conference after a meeting with his counterparts walid almuallem from syria and sergei lavrov from russia in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif says comprehensive international determination is necessary to fight and uproot terrorism in the middle east 
the iranian foreign minister made the remarks at the end of a threeway meeting among him and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid almuallem respectively in moscow on friday on the latest situation in syria 
zarif said tehran moscow and damascus should reinforce their cooperation in the campaign against terrorism 
he stressed the importance of adopting strategies to stop the delivery of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked takfiri militants wreaking havoc in syria 
the political settlement of the crisis in syria will be possible through negotiations between the sides in order to put an end to this crisis zarif said 
the three foreign ministers agreed to intensify the fight against terrorism and said their countries have a common stance on the antiterror campaign in the region particularly in syria 
lavrov said iran russia and syria have determined necessary frameworks for fighting terrorism and expressed their readiness to take measures that will play a key role in the campaign against the malicious phenomenon 
the russian foreign minister added that the moscow meeting highlighted the significance of a firm and efficient battle against terrorism in the middle east particularly in syria 
he said the meetings participants also discussed ways to send humanitarian aid to civilians in syria and stop the flow of weapons into the hands of terrorists operating in the warhit country 
muallem for his part said the us is making no effort to find a political solution to the syrian crisis 
the syrian foreign minister added that a recent agreement between washington and moscow signed in the swiss city of geneva in september failed to bear any fruit 
after marathon talks in geneva us secretary of state john kerry and his russian counterpart reached an agreement on september  to impose a ceasefire in the syrian city of aleppo and to coordinate military operations against terrorist groups in the country 
aleppo syrias second largest city remains divided between government forces in the west and foreignbacked terrorists in the east making it a frontline battleground 
russia which has been conducting an aerial military campaign against extremist militants in syria has repeatedly voiced its readiness for a ceasefire russia has been insisting however that any such lull in fighting should be accompanied with a meticulous separation of terrorists from less extremist militants fighting against the syrian government 
the syrian foreign minister said washington is not interested in solving the crisis in damascus and takes measures only to serve the its own interests and those of its regional allies 
since march  syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some western states and their regional allies backed by the russian air cover the syrian military is engaged in an operation to rid the country of daesh and other terrorist groups 
the socalled syrian observatory for human rights and united nations special envoy for syria staffan de mistura have put the death toll from the syria conflict at more than  and  respectively 
this is while the un has stopped its official casualty count in syria citing its inability to verify the figures it receives from various sources 
over the past few weeks the syrian forces have wrested control of several areas across the wartorn country as they press ahead with their counterterrorism operations 
iran russia share strong antiterror stance zarif 
meanwhile in a meeting with his russian counterpart earlier on friday the iranian foreign minister said tehran and moscow have tough stances in the fight against terrorism in the region through common strategies 
tehran and moscow have broad cooperation on regional issues such as the campaign against terrorism and extremism and we share views on these matters zarif added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r speaks with his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow russia on october   photo by reuters 
he also noted that iran and russia have succeeded in making considerable progress in all fields including in economic and political sectors as well as regional and international developments 
i am pleased that in recent years relations between the islamic republic of iran and the russian federation as two good neighbors and two key players have made many positive developments zarif said 
lavrov for his part said tehran and moscow urged cooperation on an unrelenting approach to terrorists operating against the syrian government 
iran and russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in syria moscow and tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the warhit country stressing that only the syrians are entitled to decide their own fate 
iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the syrian government in its campaign against terrorism loading",1
"abc poll oversamples dems by  claims hillary leading mainstream media oversampling democrats to create fake hillary lead kit daniels  october   comments 
in another example of poll rigging an abc presidential poll surveyed  more democrats than republicans and showed hillary clinton leading by   with a  sampling error 
abc claims its a point race with clinton ahead after polling a random national sample of  likely voters but the polls methodology reveals the poll was heavily biased in favor of hillary 
results have a margin of sampling error of  points including the design effect partisan divisions are  percent democratsrepublicansindependents abc said near the bottom of the poll 
of course hillary will be ahead in polls dominated by democrats but abc and other mainstream media outlets are betting that voters wont bother to look at a polls methodology to find the bias 
even if theres more registered democrats than republicans nationally they dont outnumber them by nearly  because otherwise republicans wouldnt be winning national races 
these kind of misleading polls really strike at their credibility as pollsters wrote media analyst aaron rossiter they seem to want the big hillary lead probably to throw off the poll averages and suppress republican voter turnout 
and if the fact that mainstream polls are adjusted to manufacture a hillary lead still sounds doubtful to you just read this leaked email from democratic consultant tom matzzie 
i also want to get your atlas folks to recommend oversamples for our polling before we start in february by market regions etc i want to get this all compiled into one set of recommendations so we can maximize what we get out of our media polling 
the email also includes this report from the atlas project on how to rig polls to get the desired result 
for example in florida a key battleground state democratic consultants recommended oversampling africanamerican and hispanic voters who lean democratic so the polls favor democrat candidates

as radicalism and hatred continue to empty their venom onto the world sowing discord enmity and selfrighteous arrogance a group of shia muslim entrepreneurs from iran saudi arabia pakistan iraq and the us imagined a technology which would speak unity amid furious sectarianism and cohesion where there was distrust
keen not only denounce but oppose the ideological abomination which is wahhabism  this dogma the house of saud rose atop the fanaticism of one heretic scholar muhammad ibn abdelwahhab th century muslims have chosen to anchor their rebuttal of extremism through the promotion of a new media platform messenger 
will likely argue that another social media platform is hardly revolutionary  especially if we consider how many apps are already available this one particular product defiantly taps into a religious movement and expression wahhabist saudi arabia has worked to silence
what in the world am i talking about
i am referring to resistance  more particularly social resistance through the affirmation of islams most sacred and universal principle justice
more why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity shia muslims gather in dc for antiterror rally letting freedom ring how islams universal message continues to speak through imam husayn ibn ali if islam has often been portrayed as the religion of peace i would personally argue that islam promotes in fact justice  this innate yearning we all share beyond the many labels we have chosen for ourselves at the heart of most
it is our refusal to bow to tyranny and accept oppression which prompted communities of man to rise against the establishment and from the ashes of empires dream themselves free
today such principles have been packaged into an app  several lines of coding put together to defy saudi arabias radical construct a tool to break free from the shackles of religious oppression
who said technology could not be revolutionary
here is where messenger  really promises to break the social sound barrier  beyond a simple exercise in technological entrepreneurship and an imperious need to reject theofascism messenger  carries the very essence of islams tradition in it name arbaeen
arbaeen means  in arabic a reference to the mourning of imam hussain ibn ali the grandson of the prophet muhammad and third imam of islam
a symbol of fortitude courage and exceptional piety imam hussains name has long echoed of islams most brilliant principles  that before tyranny none should relent that even in the most suffocating of darkness it is truth which must be spoken beyond selfinterest and beyond all fears
it is those principles messenger  ambition to promote by speaking freedom in a region locked in oppression  all thanks to saudi arabias desire to project hatred onto a faith it has proclaimed ownership over
should you have missed the momentous act of resistance this one app represents i would like to remind you that saudi arabia still forbids women to drive  that and a few other wonderful vapid social restrictions in a region where being a religious minority often equates to a death sentence thinking freedom is a revolutionary act  never mind speaking tolerance and acceptance
with less than a fortnight to go before arbaeen just as millions are making their way to karbala to remember the martyrdom of their imam he who was claimed by the forefather of terror yazid ibn muawiyah messenger  is preparing its grand launch
haidar attouq a member of the board of developers who refers to himself as a saudi citizen explained how messenger  aims to reform the way muslims think communication by fostering tolerance and peaceful exchange

"it doesnt matter what the friggin legal and ethics people say we need to win this motherfucker  mr scott foval field director americans united for change retained by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee  shares
   
an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

the president has to be kicking himself over this one 
as his term in office comes to a close it seems as if barack obama may have missed out on a pretty spectacular opportunity earlier today the president was told that he had been allowed to sleep in the white house this whole time after he spent nearly two full terms living in a hotel by reagan national airport 
sorry mr president but its true you really blew your chance on this one 
having booked an extended stay at the airport hilton upon his inauguration back in  barack and his family have resided in an atriumview room with two double beds and complimentary wifi for the past eight years but earlier this week when a senior advisor asked the president why he had chosen to live by the airport instead of the white house you could tell that obama hadnt realized the choice was his to make until that very moment 
yes obamas accomplished a lot over the years but hes got to be wondering how much more progress he might have made living at  pennsylvania avenue he would have had a lot more time to work on signature policies like the affordable care act if he hadnt wasted so much of his mornings commuting from the airport to the oval office on the dc metro theres no doubt the countless hilton rewards points obama has accrued is a nice perk but that doesnt soften the blow of leaving the neoclassic mansion built exclusively to house the commander in chief and his family empty for two full terms 
this is something obama is going to regret for a long time to come 
nobody ever explicitly told me that i could live there until now said a clearly disappointed obama as he waited patiently for a set of fresh towels while sasha and malia love being on the same floor as the pool here i now wish we had stayed at the lavish squarefoot private residence in the white house for the past eight years one time in  i slept underneath my desk after a late night and i was worried someone was going to find me there in the morning and yell at me now im being told we apparently have a personal chef and dozens of butlers this sucks 
sorry barry but this ones kind of on you our advice to whoever the next president is dont miss your chance like he did",0

"donald trump rushed off stage in reno after possible assassination attempt donald trump rushed off stage in reno after possible assassination attempt 
this account syndicates news from other media outlets november   news 
via breitbart  
republican presidential candidate donald trump was rushed offstage at a reno nevada campaign rally as a protester in the audience was involved in an extended incident near the stage 
it was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or us secret service jumped down into the area where the protester was as could be seen on right side broadcasting networks video livestream of the event 
video of trump being rushed off stage was posted online 
in the video it appears trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter two us secret service agents can be seen rushing in to remove trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal 
during his absence someone announced to the crowd that trump would return the protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or secret service agents to secure the protesters removal it was several minutes before trump was able to take the stage again 
as trump returned to the stage he thanked the crowd which cheered him back 
nobody said it was going to be easy for us but we will never be stopped never ever be stopped said trump here is the man in question in handcuffs being searched by officers after he was escorted out of the rally area pictwittercompjomctmk",0
"home this month popular the path men took to trump the path men took to trump 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics 
every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door 
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it 
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around 
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes 
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them 
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe 
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have 
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time 
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency 
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump 
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment 
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign 
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down 
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug 
from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination 
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably 
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public 
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing 
now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled 
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes 
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion 
we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes 
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next nov   roosh valizadeh",1
"a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one
furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking
attentionwhore jayde phoenix
the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of jayde phoenix  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional
as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely
if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one
try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing 
the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos
hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day
leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy 
excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and jayde phoenix read the same book
there is little doubt that jayde phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for phoenix and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance
at best as happened in phoenixs situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and jayde phoenix looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege
by the way is jayde phoenixs arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in dubai

"they knew the end of the clinton lies begins theres only one lie left october   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
during hillary clintons first presidential campaign neera tanden was described as the wonk behind hillary a close associate of the clintons tanden helped shape policy for both bill and hillary then she switched to playing that role for obama 
while hillarys email scandal broke tanden was in charge of the center for american progress a radical leftwing group that had been described as obamas idea factory and she was chatting with john podesta the top clintonite who had founded cap podesta had cochaired the obamabiden transition project neera tanden would cochair the hillarykaine transition project under podesta who headed up hillarys presidential campaign podesta had helped shape the last eight years of national politics through obama and tanden looked forward to shaping the next eight under hillary 
and what did they think of hillary did they believe their defenses of her wrongdoing 
podesta and tanden ridiculed her associates for the coverup why didnt they get this stuff out like  months ago so crazy she wondered unbelievable podesta wrote they wanted to get away with it 
since the early days of the email scandal weve been treated to the sordid rituals of feigned innocence the issue was a nonissue clinton surrogates were quick to assure us and even if it was no one did anything wrong the flies on the wall knew better though and now we can all be the flies on the wall 
away from the cameras and the briefings the clintonites held their bosses in contempt neera tanden a supposed close associate of hillary blasted her instincts as suboptimal and described her as suffering from a character problem and there was never any doubt as to what was going on 
tanden ridiculed cheryl mills for the mess mills fired off an email to podesta warning that obamas denial wouldnt hold up we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov she warned 
obama had offered his usual denial claiming to have only learned about the scandal from the media the revelation that hillary had emailed obama from her illegal address would show that he had lied but meanwhile his people struggled to reinvent his lie by claiming that while he knew about her illegal address he didnt know that it was illegal this put his lie in line with hillarys lie 
there was only one problem 
when in doubt the clintons take refuge in the final lie that you may be able to prove that they did wrong but not that they meant to do wrong that was hillarys final email defense to the fbi spliced with claims of memory loss due to a concussion was that old sergeant schultz favorite i know nothing 
but that defense completely falls apart once you prove that they did know that is what the leaked emails have begun doing they are establishing that the sergeant schultz defense is utterly hollow 
cheryl mills knew john podesta knew barack obama knew and hillary clinton knew 
when obama told a lie that could easily be disproven while trying to distance himself from hillary mills quickly fired off a warning that he had better get his story straight and his people did that makes obama complicit before and after the fact he knew what hillary was doing when she was doing it and his people participated in the effort to cover it up afterward not just to protect her but to protect him 
hillary clinton was not a rogue actor she was part of an administration that had waged a war on transparency even media allies had dubbed it as the least transparent administration in history 
lies censorship and targeting whistleblowers were the norm for obama inc a new york times reporter dubbed it the greatest enemy of press freedom in a generation the washington post noted that the obama administration routinely makes a mockery of its longago pledge to establish itself as the most transparent administration in us history the ap pointed out that it more often than ever censored government files or outright denied access to them 
bizarre administration email dodges included epa boss lisa jackson using richard windsor as her alias jacksonwindsor left the epa and took a seat on the board of the clinton foundation 
tanden and podesta didnt take issue with hillary clinton breaking the law but with her clumsy political instincts her inability to fake sincere apologies and spin scandals as smoothly as obama hillarys biggest flaw in their eyes was her clumsiness at covering up acts that were routine in in obamaworld they didnt despise her because she broke the law but because she was bad at it 
that made her a threat to their political futures 
hillarys clumsy instincts led her to the point of having to admit what she did while denying having intended to do it motive is simultaneously the strongest and weakest defense you can prove what someone else did but it is hard to prove what someone else meant to do 
unless you have their emails 
this is hillarys firewall its what every painful trickle of the scandal was meant to drag out and delay every partial revelation is buying time while bringing us closer to the final breach in the motive wall 
what the podesta emails tell us is that they knew those around hillary knew and those around them knew that the inner circle knew they knew and they hated hillary for being a bad liar and now as the inside drama of clintonworld spills across the internet the red queen moves closer to being in check 
by making it all about motive hillary clinton turned personal communications particularly emails into the key instrument of culpability that is why podestas emails are such a hot commodity its why her emails are becoming an even bigger prize 
neera tanden was right hillary clintons political instincts are suboptimal she is the member of the obama graduating class voted least likely to be able to lie convincingly on national television and she has a perverse knack for dragging everyone around her into her scandals while exposing their own 
we know that her people knew that she lied we know that obama lied all thats left is her final lie",1

"obamas un ambassador cuba is right about our human rights october   daniel greenfield 
you may remember ambassador samantha power from the time she proposed invading israel since then shes gone on to a glorious career of representing the castro regime at the un or is it the obama regime it naturally gets confusing when the us ambassador to the un sides with the enemy against her own country 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you 
under obama power was told to abstain from opposing a resolution critical of the united states and they say obama is some sort of antiamerican traitor i dont see it if he were we would be seeing signs of it by now 
anyway power then went on to audition for the job of the un ambassador from cuba by claiming that critiques from a brutal communist dictatorship about our human rights are wellfounded 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust 
somehow though siding with communist dictatorships who are the enemy while betraying our allies in the region does not create any mistrust only opposing the left does",1

"the renewed criminal investigation into hillarys misdeeds  and how it could affect the election november   matthew vadum 
democrats are in panic mode a week out from election day as they try to spin away the fbis newly announced discovery of a hoard of twothirds of a million potentially sensitive emails apparently related to hillary clintons catastrophic tenure as americas top diplomat 
partisan hack james carville is spewing wild conspiracy theories 
i think it is an outrage and i think the fact that the kgb is involved in this election is an outrage and i think the american people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for fbi director james comey thats what i think 
he added this is in effect an attempt to hijack an election it ought to be called for what it is 
just this past july comey was praised by democrats far and wide for his wisdom in opting not to pursue clinton there is evidence federal officials tried to hinder various investigations of clinton and the endlessly corrupt bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation which functions as a bribe processing center for wouldbe president hillary clinton 
but democrats have suddenly flipped sides denouncing comey as an enemy of the republic now that he has opened an investigation into the newly discovered emails 
carville long known as the ragin cajun is apoplectic because he thinks these emails could change the dynamics of the election 
the old clinton hand may be right 
investigators found  emails on a laptop computer they believe was used at home by disgraced former rep anthony weiner d and his wife longtime senior hillary aide huma abedin the computer is reportedly the same device serial pervert weiner used to send sexual messages to an underage girl 
underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that mrs clinton used while she was secretary of state according to people familiar with the matter reports the wall street journal  some of the information emailed may have been classified 
abedin who has intergenerational ties to the muslim brotherhood reportedly forwarded sensitive government information to her personal yahoo email account and may have viewed them on her home laptop 
over the objections of attorney general loretta lynch comey notified congress of the information about the previously unknown emails at this late stage in the election cycle because after letting hillary off the hook this summer he was facing a huge uprising among fbi employees the overwhelming majority of whom are not unprincipled supplicants to power 
lynch is doing her best to make sure the department of justice probe goes nowhere 
assistant attorney general for legislative affairs peter j kadzik whom zero hedge calls the best friend of john podesta hillarys campaign chairman and former white house chief of staff in bill clintons administration is heading up the email probe 
so the fix is in 
in any event the prospect of restoring his good name may also have prompted comey to act 
people are upset at comey because he took the cowards way out in the email investigation and is viewed as helping the clinton team and the obama white house in their efforts to cover up wrongdoing 
it was back on july  comey announced that despite the massive body of damning evidence accumulating against clinton he would not recommend charges be brought against the former secretary of state for her use of hackerfriendly homebrew private email servers to conduct official business clinton and her aides were extremely careless in their handling of classified documents but there was no evidence of criminal intent he said even though the relevant national security statute does not require intent the next day attorney general lynch confirmed no charges would be laid against hillary lynch as everyone now knows had a clandestine meeting with former president bill clinton at a phoenix airport a week before at which a corrupt bargain was presumably made 
this internal rebellion in the investigative agency was serious enough that comey felt he had to act immediately 
i have some sources in the fbi and the former district attorneys commentator larry kudlow said sunday on nbcs meet the press the fbi is in full revolt right now the fbi has been in full revolt since the decisions made last summer 
ever the hillary shill host chuck todd corrected kudlow 
not full revolt he said theres been a lot i mean itsthere are agentslets not say full revolt 
all right a semifull revolt said kudlow 
because what im getting at is if comey hadnt said what he said to congress and the rest of the world it would have leaked it would have leaked that whole building was ready to leak that they had discovered this new source with anthony weiner and huma abedin so i dont think comey had much chance here and i think the fbi is badly divided 
meanwhile the trickle of bad news for hillary clinton has turned into a raging flood in the last few days 
clinton has been directly implicated in a nasty false flag operation against the donald trump campaign top democrat operatives robert creamer and scott foval were caught on undercover video describing their involvement in an elaborate criminal conspiracy involving the use of targeted political violence against political opponents the euphemism employed was conflict engagement which means paying leftist agitators the homeless and the mentally ill to cause melees at trump rallies 
fomenting violence and physically attacking political opponents was what the fascist third reich did using the sturmabteilung or sa also called brown shirts and storm troopers 
longtime democrat pollster and campaign consultant doug schoen a familiar face on fox news channel announced he could no longer in good conscience support clintons candidacy 
im deeply concerned that well have a constitutional crisis if shes elected he said sunday if the secretary of state wins we will have a president under criminal investigation with top aide huma abedin under criminal investigation 
republican donald trump is closing the gap in national polls of likely voters 
clintons unfavorability rating in polls now exceeds trumps shes at  percent hes at  percent 
former new york mayor and leading trump surrogate rudy giuliani said over the weekend that enough evidence has surfaced from wikileaks and the fbi to indict clinton for racketeering bill clinton does the speeches they put the money in the pocket she does the favors in the government said giuliani a former federal prosecutor it all links up why did they destroy  emails because it shows the link 
influential liberal journalist ron fournier threw hillary under the bus mrs clinton got a secret server to protect what the washington post called the circle of enrichment he said 
if hillary clinton wins next week media outlets across america will have to hire extra investigative journalists to handle all the corruption exposes that will follow",1

republican presidential candidate donald trump signaled thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of promoting american pride and patriotism in americas schools 
in a trump administration i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to americas children trump said speaking at the american legions annual convention in cincinnati 
we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of americas history its institutions and its heroes many of whom are with us today he told the veterans group 
the comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools which is prohibited under federal lawwe will stop apologizing for america and we will start celebrating america we will be united by our common culture values and principles becoming one american nation one country under one constitution saluting one american flag and always saluting it trump said 
last year a denverarea school board sought to change the content of the ap us history course because some board members thought it failed to promote patriotism 
that sparked a political proxy war in jefferson county colorado and the  school board election drew nearly  million in campaign funding from outside interest groups 
public schools nationwide are funded by their local communities along with some state money most schools receive little federal funding 
current federal law prohibits the federal government from exercising any direction supervision or control over the curriculum program of instruction administration or personnel of any educational institution school or school system",0

"thirtytwoyearold samantha collins she may not look like your typical hero but her incredible story is one you absolutely need to read right now against all odds this courageous young woman woke up and went to work today 
amazing we should all strive to be as fearless as samantha 
when her alarm sounded this morning at  am samantha dug deep and did something unbelievable summoning all the willpower she had she somehow found the strength inside herself to pull back her sheets and put two feet on the floor as if this were any other day 
samantha then headed straight into the shower where she miraculously managed to shampoo her hair turn off the water and even get dressed for work before resolutely grabbing a granola bar as she headed out the door 
her remarkable heroism didnt stop there defying all her basic instincts samantha was soon sitting on a bus while it drove in the direction of her office faced with a situation where other women might have given up samantha bravely stood up pressed the button to request her stop and even had the conviction to get off the bus when it came to a halt 
this womans courage and determination should be an inspiration to us all 
as if this story werent already inspiring enough samantha then went to all three of her morning meetings battling through intermittent waves of nausea and behaving as if nothing at all had changed since last night 
incredible the world could use a few more heroes like samantha who refuse to let anything stop them from going through the motions returning home and getting ready to do it all again every day for at least the next four years keep fighting the good fight samantha",0
why i wont vote for hillary clinton  evan edinger but then he changes his mind on that to close evan edlinger will vote for hillary against trump because he thinks that whereas hillarys actual trackrecord of policies not mere statements in public office have been horrific trumps bad statements and lack of any trackrecord in public office at all make trump even worse thats what he thinks i think it makes trump better  the better choice  as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official hillary clinton edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official to no record as a public official edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions one is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements versus actual political policies carried out as a public official which show hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of wall street and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a persons private or business affairs versus a bad record as an actual public official only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying  and thats clinton not trump who has a horrific record as a public official trump has no record at all as a public official edlinger at  in his video says that when he contemplates voting for hillarytheres always one thing that comes in the way and thats trust he says he doesnt trust her  but what he doesnt actually trust is her words when he says hell vote for her hes simply ignoring her actions hes ignoring the real personasapublicofficial the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever proven selfishness in ones private life is bad but proven selfishness and evil in ones publicoffice policies such as we came we saw he died ha ha  is utterly disqualifying i argued in my im a bernie sanders voter heres why ill vote trump  that trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive president but even if he turns out to be a bad president he wont on balance be as horrific as will a president hillary clinton with trump there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world with clinton there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors,0
"the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context
book of job 
job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god allows satan to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children
once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die
i would rather be strangled
rather die than suffer like this
i hate my life and dont want to go on living
oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job 
why make me your target
am i a burden to you
why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt
for soon i will lie down in the dust and die
when you look for me i will be gone job 
what do you gain by oppressing me
why do you reject me the work of your own hands
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job 
he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words
the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine
its branches spreading across the garden
its roots grow down through a pile of stones
it takes hold on a bed of rocks
but when it is uprooted
its as though it never existed job 
when a plague sweeps through
he laughs at the death of the innocent
the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked
and god blinds the eyes of the judges
if hes not the one who does it who is job 
just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life
whatever happens i will be found guilty
so whats the use of trying
even if i were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
and my own filthy clothing would hate me job 
the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions
pay attention to this job
stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god
do you know how god controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds
do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill
when you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror
can you do that job 
god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan
who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words
brace yourself like a man
because i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
tell me if you know so much
who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line
what supports its foundations
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy job 
god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence
then the lord said to job
do you still want to argue with the almighty
you are gods critic but do you have the answers
then job replied to the lord
i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers
i will cover my mouth with my hand
i have said too much already
i have nothing more to say job 
you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance
it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about
things far too wonderful for me
you said listen and i will speak
i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
i had only heard about you before
but now i have seen you with my own eyes
i take back everything i said
and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job 
other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue
wake up o lord why do you sleep
get up do not reject us forever
why do you look the other way
why do you ignore our suffering and oppression
we collapse in the dust
lying face down in the dirt
rise up help us
ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm 
and the usual response is to not question god
what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator
does a clay pot argue with its maker
does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying
stop youre doing it wrong
does the pot exclaim
how clumsy can you be
how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father
why was i born
or if it said to its mother
why did you make me this way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before
so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job 
you have to be patient with god
those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm 
the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other
book of ecclesiastes 
the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned
everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes 
what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes 
so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes 
all is vanity
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes 
promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god
i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does
when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes 
at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery
so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job
the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior

"hillary campaign launching attacks on the fbi october   
if the clinton campaign becomes any more deranged hillary will start running attack ads against the fbi this kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad 
hillary clintons presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the fbi on sunday circulating a draft letter critical of james comey to former federal prosecutors 
it is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the united states department of justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees the clinton campaigns letter speaking for prosecutors said 
the letter was signed and provided to the daily beast by elkan abramowitz a former chief of the criminal division of the us attorney for the southern district of new york it is expected to be released sunday evening 
so we have the bizarre spectacle of hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the fbi who was just being praised for clearing her because when youre a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies this is how you react but its also telling that the clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the fbi",1

" incredible animal mating rituals posted today email you know the birds and the bees what about the rest here are seven mating rituals that showcase nature in all its complexity and beauty 
orangutans orangutans are among a special group of animals with mating rituals based around the lunar cycle meaning that whenever a full moon is in the sky male orangutans will climb the tallest tree and try to have sex with the moon only settling for a female orangutan once they grow tired of stretching their penises outward so they might touch the moon with it 
armadillos in the armadillos song the male armadillos penis makes an annoying highpitched whirring sound until a female armadillo is so annoyed by it that she silences it by having sex with him 
alligators during mating season male alligators stand upright and walk around on their hind legs and place their arms on their hips and sometimes even ride bikes until a female alligator gets horny from watching them 
beavers the male beaver and female beaver each recite a fun fact about beavers taking a step closer to one another as they do so at some point they get so close that theyre actually mating

  clinton corruption  john podesta  crime family naturalnews its not just that the corruption and criminality of the clintons knows no bounds its also that the democrat political machine trying to thrust her into power also has total disregard for democracy truth and ethics their mission put our nations worst political criminal into the white house by any means necessary including systematic lying fraud money laundering intimidation of opponents and even murder of those who might testify against her the clinton machine is a mafia operation  and every person involved in it must go to jailthat includes not just the deep operatives like podesta lynch and abedin but also all the deep cover clinton operatives pretending to be journalists  including stephanopoulos maddow hayes milbank and all the rest  see the list here  every one of these people has committed crimes of sedition against the united states of america and is guilty of attempting to defraud democracy steal the election and place a mafia criminal into power at the highest level of government through the deliberate pursuit of journalistic malpractice  seditious clinton operatives must be arrested and put behind bars to protect america we the people are beyond the stage of merely wanting to vote you out of power and turn off your broadcast networks its now time to seek your indictment and imprisonment so that you cannot be allowed to harm this society ever againevery operative journalist and coconspirator with the clinton foundation the clinton corruption and the clinton murders must be arrested indicted and if found guilty by a fair trial sent to prison this nation needs to heal itself from the clinton nightmare  and the only way thats going to happen is if the criminal traitors sellouts and corrupt backstabbers are marched away in handcuffs and put behind barsa former fbi official said sunday that bill and hillary clinton are part of a crime family and argued top officials hindered the investigation into hillary clintons private email server while she was secretary of state reports thehillcom  kallstrom best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of twa flight  in the late s said that hillary clinton the democratic presidential nominee was a pathological liarhe also blasted attorney general loretta lynch claiming that she impeded the investigation into clintons private serverthe problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation he said thats the problem they never had a grand jury empanelled and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled im sure is loretta lynch would not go along with that god forbid we put someone like that in the white house he added of clintonkallstrom also said that fbi director james comey and the rest of the fbis leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation not the rest of the bureauthe agents are furious with whats going on i know that for a fact he said corrupt proclinton journalists should not be given any quarter in all this much like the propagandists of the third reich they abuse their positions of power to operate in conspiracy with an outright criminal who acts against the interests of the american people did you know that hillary clinton sold off uranium mining rights to the russians because the oligarchs who made billions off the deal turned around and donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false smear attacks against donald trump every element of the democrat party is hopelessly corrupt democrat political operatives abide by no laws no ethics and no boundaries they lie cheat and steal their way into power at every election and theyre desperately trying to steal this election tooits not just that the clinton crime family must be taken down you see its that the entire democrat establishment should be disbanded or imprisoned  there isnt a highlevel operative inside the dnc who isnt committing election fraud on a daily basis the coordination and collusion money laundering and paytoplay influence for sale schemes are all illegal yet they are the very foundation of the democrat establishment as it exists todayevery one of these people needs to be arrested indicted and imprisoned this is the only way genuine democracy can be restored across america aside from their criminality democrats policy ideas just dont work even on policy alone democrats are total failures  none of their ideas or policies actually work look at obamacare with its insurance costs now doubling every  years  with coverage options crashing nationwide and the entire failed idea now on the verge of imploding this was hailed as an historic solution by obama and the rest of the dummocrats who forced it through congress and the supreme court in reality obamacare was the dumbest idea ever attempted to solve the health care crisis and i called it that from its inceptiondemocrats are parasites on society who know nothing other than how to survive as government blood suckers by promising big ideas that routinely fail they confiscate money from taxpayers waste it on the most stupid policy ideas ever dreamed up while siphoning off billions for their own salaries bonuses and luxurious lifestyles then if you oppose their complete idiocy they invoke the irs to have you audited or arrested this is amerika today under obama and the clintonsthis racket must end the clintons and all their coconspirators must be sent to prison donald trump is right when he says this is bigger than watergate theres no comparison the crimes of the clintons are a thousand times larger and more

"home  badge abuse  cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim matt agorist november    comment 
denver co  a denver cop has been arrested and suspended without pay after his own body camera footage caught him stealing  in cash from a crash victim 
instead of helping an unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage of the situation for his own personal gain by going through the mans clothing and robbing him archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence 
according to an arrest affidavit archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of october  the call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed the driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious 
archuletas body camera then recorded the officer for the next  minutes and  seconds in the footage he took pictures of the scene and then searched the mans clothing which had been removed by paramedics 
in the video archuleta finds a stack of cash in the mans pants with a  bill on top according to the arrest affidavit he then separates the  bill from the stack and a  bill remains on top 
throughout the footage archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car the affidavit said 
according to the denver post when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence he counted  and did not find any  bills the affidavit said but while reviewing archuletas body camera footage as part of the investigation the detective noticed the  bill 
amazingly enough instead of covering up the theft the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the  bill to internal affairs when confronted by investigators archuleta told them he would check his war bag to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car 
according to the arrest affidavit archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found   bills that must have fallen in his bag after being caught redhanded archuleta then turned in the money 
according to the post the denver district attorneys office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspects vehicle before detectives had a search warrant the affidavit said 
earlier this year the denver police department was equipped with body cameras we now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them archuleta will now go down in history as the first denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence 
like most cases of police theft this incident is not isolated in fact just  months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney  was arrested after an investigation found that hed stolen both money and marijuana from the police department like archuleta he entire theft was captured on the officers own body camera mckinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution conspiracy and felony embezzlement 
state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales for drug distribution and conspiracy both were arrested in albuquerque and booked into the sandoval county detention center according to kob 
public information officer for the new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from mckinneys lapel camera that exposed possible illicit activity by a grants police department sergeant 
what does it say about the criminal tendency of some police officers when they are unable to practice restraint from theft  knowing that they are being recorded share google  the kali whrite boi 
ok am not cool with corrupt criminal cops but still this msm puppet is infuriating this civilian was fleeing a scene of shots fired leading the cop in a short chase before crashing 
stupid msm puppets",1

nur das auch barack obamas private leistungen sollen nachträglich revidiert werden darunter auch seine doktorarbeit aus dem jahr  zudem soll eine im jahr  von obama gerettete angefahrene katze ausfindig gemacht und getötet werden  rückzug aus krisengebieten donald trump will dass die vereinigten staaten aufhören weltpolizei zu spielen und sich mehr auf sich selbst konzentrieren hierzulande wird das zur folge haben dass unsere politiker behaupten deutschland müsse nun international mehr verantwortung übernehmen was zu mehr aufrüstung und kriegseinsätzen führen wird ganz anders sähe es aus hätte hillary gewonnen sie hätte deutschland zu mehr internationaler verantwortung gedrängt woraufhin deutsche politiker bereitwillig aufgerüstet hätten um mehr kriegseinsätze bewältigen zu können  burkapflicht für alle frauen die keine sieben oder höher sind diese maßnahme liegt donald trump besonders am herzen alle frauen die von dem milliardär visuell weniger als sieben von zehn möglichen

krisen im nahen osten übernehmen  umbau des yosemitenationalparks in einen luxusgolfplatz mit der umweltpolitik seines vorgängers barack obama hat donald trump nichts am hut das erkennt man auch daran

"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

"military british defense secretary michael fallon photo by afp 
british defense minister michael fallon says the uk is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the baltic region in europe to support its nato allies in the face of a more assertive russia 
fallon told a nato ministerial meeting in brussels on wednesday that britain would send  soldiers to estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to natos enhanced forward presence in eastern europe 
backed by a rising defense budget this deployment of air land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in nato supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance fallon said 
nato had announced in july that it would deploy on a rotational basis four multinational battalions to poland and the baltic statesestonia latvia and lithuaniato deter what it referred to as any russian incursion 
during his address at the meeting fallon also said that four british typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to romania under the nato southern air policing mission which is supposed to protect the baltic states airspace against possible attacks from russia 
this is about two things reassurance and that needs to be done with some formidable presence and deterrence fallon had said in an earlier interview this is not simply a tripwirethis is a serious military presence 
the move is likely to draw criticism from moscow which has been angered by natos military buildup on its western borders 
the usled military alliance cut its ties with moscow in  and has been reinforcing its presence near russias borders ever since 
the uk and russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues mainly the conflicts in syria and ukraine 
the two countries military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations with britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept russian bombers and naval fleets 
the latest of those encounters occurred on thursday when the russian aircraft career admiral kuznetsov and its sevenship task force were shadowed by two british warships on a course to sail through the north sea and english channel on their way to syria loading",1

a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide

concern grows over soroslinked voting machines   
sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire  
by edmund kozak  updated  oct  at  pm  
concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist george soros and his personal quest to create a nationless borderless global state 

the ukbased smartmatic company posted a flowchart on its website that it had provided voting machines for  states including important battleground states like florida and arizona smartmatic chairman mark mallochbrown is a former un official and sits on the board of soros open society foundations since the story first broke the flowchart has disappeared from smartmatics website raising further questions about the real status of the sorostied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in us elections 

if mallochbrowns soros ties werent troubling enough he also has ties to the clintons through his work at two consulting firms 

according to a spokesperson for the national association of secretaries of state smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states have contested that their equipment came from smartmatic why then had smartmatic bragged about providing over  voting machines for us elections

give it up already its over k j gillenwater was the primary researcher behind this story 

hillary clintons email server company got almost  million in government loans starting immediately after they were secretly asked to wipe hillary clintons name from her emails 

platte river networks prn got a  loan from the small business administration in august  and another  loan in september  

public government data available as usaspendinggov 

the first halfmillion dollar loan arrived not one month after prn employee paul combetta was caught accidentally revealing his company was deleting evidence at hillarys request in july   

the second  loan came about one year later 

you wont hear this stuff from the lying mainstream media keep the gotnews mission alive donate at gotnewscomdonate or send tips to editorgotnewscom if youd like to join our research team contacteditorgotnewscom 

after getting the first loan prn moved to a large office space after previously working out of the owners condo the head of the small business administration is maria contrerassweet  a mexican immigrant who was appointed to the office by barack obama two months before hillarys prn got the first loan 

wikileaks leaks have proven hillarys corrupt paytoplay scheme gotnews has shined a light on how hillary gets favors from hispanic and democratic government bureaucrats before  

did hillary clinton pay her email server company platte river networks prn with almost  million in favorable government loans  given out by a political friendly  in order to alter her illegal emails and get her name off them 

it sure looks like it

police conclude search of starnet   
cbc news posted aug    am et last updated aug    am et  
police have wrapped up several days of searching the offices of starnet communications in vancouver they entered the company offices and homes of some directors on friday 

police were looking for evidence of illegal gambling distributing child pornography and money laundering since the raid starnet officials say police just dont understand their business 

the search warrant details  months of police investigation it traces a network of companies registered in american and caribbean jurisdictions 

the warrant also identifies vancouver as the centre of starnets operations even though this is a grey under canadian law 

police note that starnets revenues grew dramatically in the past two years from betting and sex shows and from lucrative licensing agreements for its gaming software the investigations and pornography from company sites were grounds for fridays raid and seizure of company materials 

rcmp constable peter thiessen says investigators left starnet offices yesterday morning he says they spent the better part of three days going through the business and as a result of that search the investigation is continuing but no charges have been laid starnets many investors were spooked by the raid share prices dropped almost percent on friday however the company insists the raid had minimal effect on its operation stocks rose slightly yesterday after a day of very heavy trading 

in written statements company ceo mark dohlen said the wall street journal calls starnet the leader in internet gaming and entertainment he says companies like his those on the cutting edge are often misunderstood yesterday starnet announced it will sell off the sex side of its business it plans to focus more resources on gaming 

the police investigation is expected to last for several more months

july   developments in pki occurred in the early s at the british intelligence agency gchq  where james ellis  clifford cocks and others made important discoveries related to encryption algorithms and key distribution   however as developments at gchq are highly classified the results of this work were kept secret and not publicly acknowledged until the mids 

the public disclosure of both secure key exchange and asymmetric key algorithms in  by diffie hellman  rivest shamir  and adleman changed secure communications entirely with the further development of highspeed digital electronic communications the internet and its predecessors a need became evident for ways in which users could securely communicate with each other and as a further consequence of that for ways in which users could be sure with whom they were actually interacting 

assorted cryptographic protocols were invented and analyzed within which the new cryptographic primitives could be effectively used with the invention of the world wide web and its rapid spread the need for authentication and secure communication became still more acute commercial reasons alone eg ecommerce online access to proprietary databases from web browsers were sufficient taher elgamal and others at netscape developed the ssl protocol https in web urls it included key establishment server authentication prior to v oneway only and so on a pki structure was thus created for web userssites wishing secure communications 

vendors and entrepreneurs saw the possibility of a large market started companies or new projects at existing companies and began to agitate for legal recognition and protection from liability an american bar association technology project published an extensive analysis of some of the foreseeable legal aspects of pki operations see aba digital signature guidelines and shortly thereafter several us states utah being the first in  and other jurisdictions throughout the world began to enact laws and adopt regulations consumer groups raised questions about privacy access and liability considerations which were more taken into consideration in some jurisdictions than in others 

the enacted laws and regulations differed there were technical and operational problems in converting pki schemes into successful commercial operation and progress has been much slower than pioneers had imagined it would be 

by the first few years of the st century the underlying cryptographic engineering was clearly not easy to deploy correctly operating procedures manual or automatic were not easy to correctly design nor even if so designed to execute perfectly which the engineering required the standards that existed were insufficient 

pki vendors have found a market but it is not quite the market envisioned in the mids and it has grown both more slowly and in somewhat different ways than were anticipated pkis have not solved some of the problems they were expected to and several major vendors have gone out of business or been acquired by others pki has had the most success in government implementations the largest pki implementation to date is the defense information systems agency disa pki infrastructure for the common access cards program

link years ago i came here for the ufos and after a small amount of time i stopped believing mostly due to nothing being real anymore most stuff is faked at least in my opinion the below is true even if its not as exciting as cgi videos my main reason for posting is about one of the very few times i saw stuff back in summer of july i went on a camping trip to possum kingdom lake in west texas with a friend robert my last trip as a single guy before i got married the following month the trip was a lot of canoeing swimming cliff diving snorkeling and camping out at night beneath the stars no tent just star gazing while we eventually drifted off to sleep nightly robert and i were best friends and also worked together too anyway one really really dark chilly and moonless night about pm or so we had tucked ourselves in our sleeping bags and had a really good spot elevated with no distractions to look at the night sky i had excellent vision then and could see pretty danged good i was  my friend was  he partook of the herb and drank beer daily and i consumed a few beers daily by nightfall we were tuckered out and wanted nothing more than to just go to sleep the heat of the west texas day really took it out of us the campsite was only accessed by boat we used a rental canoe so we paddled our way to this place that was a fairly large and very rugged rocky peninsula with some cliffs being  foot high they seemed a lot taller to me we camped on the top of the cliffs at night and played down on the water by day so this one night i was looking at a particular spot up there above us and he was looking at another i then saw it and said look right there he having binoculars he looked at where i had pointed saw it and got pretty excited he finally let me look at it through his binoculars and what i saw was the following slightly larger than what we normally see a satellite was a transparent or semitransparent and faint bluish looking sphere a clear bubble really moving at a speed i remember as being slightly faster than what a satellite would be going but not so much faster or slower than any planejet traffic would be in my estimation it was going south and we watched it by passing the binoculars back and forth we both assumed it was a satellite exciting stuff but then one of us i really cant remember who noticed another one this time coming from the east they appeared to be on a course that appeared to us that would be really a close call if they were at the same altitude when they were getting a little too close for comfort at least for us the one that came from the east shot a light bluish light at the southbound sphere it wasnt laserlike at all i dont think but it appeared more like a vshaped beam from a flashlight shot at it it lasted all of a second and i am positive that it happened due to we both saw it at the same time the light flash made the southbound one turn westward now going almost the same direction as the one from the east making them both going in the same direction actually the one that got flashed didnt make a  degree turn it was really going more of a path more like westsouthwest more like  degrees or so just guessing now when i say that it turned it turned abruptly not at all anything like any plane would do that struck us both as being odd no curving involved at all we watched them until they both grew dim from the distance both staying in a straight line to their intended destination of course we kept thinking that the one that flashed the beam would turn and follow the other but nope i could be wrong on the speed and the directions but the rest is completely accurate the really sharp turn back then was unheard of we hear it all of the time now years ago though it wasnt talked about at all not even in the tabloids this is why this really stood out out to me all of these years that almost  degree turn to be honest i just didnt understand what we had just seen we finally got to sleep that night i dont know how long it took us but we did but after a few hours around ish am robert woke me up and said listen and i heard footsteps that scared us pretty good cause we had gotten so worked up earlier i guess heheh we listened to the small branches and small gravel rocks moving beneath whatever it was that was about to kill us well we did until we finally scared ourselves to sleep i have to admit ok yeah i did partake myself but only a little bit i wasnt into it like him but i was on vacation that made us both very paranoid i guess anyway the next morning we found our bread and peanut butter missing the breads plastic wrapper was there but no bread creepy a few years later my boss who i had told all of this to and he made fun of me told me that the same thing happened to him his peanut butter and bread went missing while camped on a river they determined that it was a raccoon which they do this sort of thing i know now now to regular people that might not seem like much especially now days here on this forum more spectacular claims are made daily still for back then it was really something my older brother by  years and i were camping with no tent underneath the starry sky of caddo lake in east texas around  in the spring may i think and we were looking at a patch of sky surrounded by silhouetted trees actually talking about when we were kids looking for flying saucers thats all they were known as back then our entire family would look out at the sky in our backyard it was a common thing for us to do back in the fifties after all that was its heyday as we stared at the sky in the back of my pickup i mentioned the bluish sphere that i had seen years before at possum kingdom lake he being quiet through the entire story he wasnt that talkative really and within  minutes of me mentioning this to him we saw one i had my own binoculars this time i was really amazed it was exactly as what i had seen before i mean exactly nothing major happened though it just quietly slid across the sky in front of us and disappeared behind the trees to our right and that was that my brother was never a believer anyway maybe had it landed it would change his mind we saw several regular ol satellites afterwards too why i even bring this up is that when i first started coming here around  lurking i read a thread of a guy here that saw the exact thing i did with the slightly vshaped flashlight looking beam and the other blue sphere turning away id really love to read that again it was a good feeling to be somewhat confirmed i say confirmed because that friend robert that witnessed the sphere denied it in front of a lot of people at work we hardly talked about anything else on that trip and especially on the way home too assuming he felt as i did i brought it up when a bunch of guys were taking a break at work maybe  people i didnt see the harm in telling what we saw after i said my piece i said ask robert robert said i was crazy and he didnt see a thing i thought he was kidding but he was being serious youd think that on the way back hed say that he wasnt wanting to tell anyone but nooo edit on  by recrisp because typo,0

censorship by facebook has become a thorn in the side of nearly anyone with an opinion differing from the narrative touted by the corporate press  for instance sentiments not praising hillary clinton  and now through both a new report from reuters and emails published by wikileaks we have insight into why certain posts are targeted 
facebook relies on a combination of artificial intelligence and human judgment to remove posts deemed offensive violent or otherwise unacceptable to its community standards  but precisely how the ultimate call to take down posts pages and groups are made remains unknown 
and facebook takedowns no matter the improvements to the process the social media behemoth claims to make have been no less controversial or questionable  and those whose posts are censored have little if any recourse to argue their case 
recent examples of headscratchers which led to an international uproar include facebooks removal of the iconic vietnam war photograph of phan th? kim phúc  who at just yearsold was captured on film by an associated press photographer fleeing the aftermath of an errant napalm attack near a buddhist pagoda in the village of trang bang 
that photograph helped cement in the collective american mind the horrors of the war and ultimately fueled the success of the antiwar effort  but facebook arbitrarily pulled the image for nudity  and proceeded even to ban the page of the conservative prime minister of norway for also posting the image 
ultimately the social media company reversed course in that case  but not before also taking down the equally iconic image of civil rights leader rosa parks arrest 
but taking down of the image of kim phúc might not have been simply an error of ai since it had been used as a specific example in training the teams responsible for content removal two unnamed former facebook employees told reuters  
trainers told contentmonitoring staffers that the photo violated facebook policy despite its historical significance because it depicted a naked child in distress photographed without her consent the employees told reuters 
in the final decision to reverse that censorship facebook head of the community operations division justin osofsky admitted it had been a mistake 
according to reuters  to whom many current and former facebook employees spoke on condition of anonymity the process of judging which posts deserve to be remove and which should be allowed will in certain instances be left to the discretion of a small cadre of the companys elite executives 
in addition to osofsky global policy chief monika bickert government relations chief joel kaplan vice president for public policy and communications elliot schrage and facebook chief operating officer sheryl sandberg make the final call on censorship and appeals 
all five studied at harvard and four of them have both undergraduate and graduate degrees from the elite institution all but sandberg hold law degrees three of the executives have longstanding personal ties to sandberg the outlet notes chief executive mark zuckerberg also occasionally offers guidance in difficult decisions but there are others 
company spokeswoman christine chen explained facebook has a broad diverse and global network involved in content policy and enforcement with different managers and senior executives being pulled in depending on the region and the issue at hand 
for those on the receiving end of what could only be described as lopsided and inexplicable censorship recourse is generally limited and can be nearly impossible to come by often the nature of posts and pages removed insinuates political motivations on the part of the censors 
indeed and once again flaring international controversy facebook disabled  among others the accounts of editors of quds and shehab new agency  prominent palestinian media organizations  without explanation or even a specific example given for justification 
although three of four palestinianfocused accounts were restored facebook refused to comment to either reuters or the accounts owners why the decision was reversed except to say it had been an error 
in fact although chen and other facebook insiders spoke with reuters directly about contentious content removal policies and procedures many details of the processes remain covert and sorely intransparent to the public who is so often forced to cope with the consequences 
earlier this year an exposé by gizmodo showing facebooks suppression of conservative outlets via its trending topics section appeared to evidence extreme bias in favor of liberal and corporate media mainstays alternative media too which provides reports counter to the mainstream political and foreign policy paradigm has often been the subject of controversial takedowns censorship and suppressive tactics  either directly by facebook or through convoluted algorithms and artificial intelligence bots 
however considering sheryl sandberg and her loyalists populate the toplevel group deciding the fate for content removal complaints it would appear wikileaks could provide answers for both post censorship and suppression of outlets not vowing complete fealty to the preferred leftleaning narrative 
in a june   email to clinton campaign chair john podesta  an enormous cache of whose emails are still being published on a daily basis by wikileaks  penned by sandberg in response to condolences on the death of her husband states  in part 
and i still want hrc to win badly i am still here to help as i can she came over and was magical with my kids 
after a wave of post removals and temporary page bans it appears facebook has begun to come to its senses for what actually violates community standards  and what might have political worth contrary to the views of its executives 
senior members of facebooks policy team recently posted about the laxing of rules governing community standards which  though welcome  might only provide temporary relief quoted by the wall street journal  they wrote  
in the weeks ahead were going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interesteven if they might otherwise violate our standards 
while the social media giant deems itself a technology and not news platform facebook is still the bouncing off point for issues of interest for an overwhelming percentage of its users although it perhaps has some responsibility in regard to the removal of certain content putting censorship in the hands of only a few individuals in certain instances is a chilling reminder of the fragility  and grave importance  of free speech dont forget to follow the dc clothesline on facebook and twitter please help spread the word by sharing our articles on your favorite social networks share this",0

former illinois congressman and conservative radio host joe walsh appeared to invite armed insurrection when he tweeted that he was grabbing his musket if hillary clinton defeats donald trump in the presidential election

walshfreedom what exactly does that mean cnns jake tapper tweeted in reply 
jaketapper it means protesting walsh tweeted participating in acts of civil disobedience doing what it takes to get our country back 
walshs rhetoric comes as americans are already nervous about what will happen on and after election day trumps insistence that the election is rigged and his statement at the last debate that he would keep america in suspense about whether or not he will accept the results have left some in fear that violence could flare up if his supporters refuse to accept the outcome 
more than half of americans expressed concern about violence on election day according to a usa todaysuffolk university poll released wednesday 
walsh dismissed another twitter users concern that his call to arms could draw the attention of the secret service saying they understand that a musket hasnt been used in battle in almost  years 
im serious walsh tweeted later i dont think a musket would do much good these days but its time for civil disobedience on the right 
walsh repeated his defense that he was only speaking of civil disobedience to nbcs chicago affiliate were talking about a musket walsh said according to nbc  chicago i couldve said grab your slingshot and lets go metaphorically i meant grab your muskets if trump loses man were going to do what we have to do were going to protest and boycott and practice civil disobedience we may start a third party

"time investigating hillary is an attack on all women november   
good morning its tuesday 
whos up for another silly attempt to claim that hillary clinton is only being investigated for her rogue email setup because shes a woman this gem comes from robin lakoff a berkeley professor in sustained incoherence and special pleading 
hillary clintons emailgate is an attack on women 
its not about emails its about public communication by a woman 
i am mad i am mad because i am scared and if you are a woman you should be too emailgate is a bitch hunt but the target is not hillary clinton its us 
the only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female can you imagine this happening to a man 
his name was general petraeus thank you have a nice day 
clinton is guilty of swf speaking while female and emailgate is just a reminder to us all that she has no business doing what shes doing and must be punished for the sake of all decent women everywhere there is so much of that going around 
that escalated quickly and incoherently also im pretty sure its not the s or whatever decade robin is parodying or channeling but yes hillary clinton is only in this mess because shes a woman it has nothing to do with anything else that must be why albright and rice werent in the center of similar scandals 
if the candidate were male there would be no scolding and no scandal those very ideas would be absurd men have a nearly absolute right to freedom of speech in theory so do women but that as the creationists like to say is only a theory 
emailing classified information on your server to avoid transparency regulations is not free speech its illegal for both public officials of both genders 
but heres hillary rodham clinton the very public standin for all bossy uppity and ambitious women here are her emails and since its a woman doing what decent women should never doengaging in highlevel public communicationwell there must be something wrong with that even if we cant quite find that something

"keywords food packaging  packaging 
one of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals however most of these organic foods such as beans  often come in packaging which if not done well there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company 
various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food investigate your packaging kitchen and youll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about regardless of the possibility that youre for the most part a real food type of individual you presumably have canned merchandise oats pastas and granola bars packaged in plastic bags plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom 
most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem by all accounts to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with bpa bps or deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc which contains the known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride your canned soup soda significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to bpa and different compounds youre in an ideal situation not ingesting 
even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like pfass which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food extra chemicals from flame retardants to bpa have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants 
the environmental working group ewg has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for bpa in their food packaging they built up the database since they contend that consumers have a right to recognize whats in their food  particularly with regards to an ingredient for example bpa that has been linked to cancer infertility mind nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity and different genuine disorders theres no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food 
a wholefood unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging also it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body 
one of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs there are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health but it can ruin your name as the packaging company below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging at the point when conceivable avoid canned foods and beverages plastic wrap and plastic bottles instead pick a glass when you can and cook beans yourself but if you must buy look out for the reputable packaging companies accomplish your very own greater amount food preservation to lessen your exposure to packaging chemicals have a go at dehydrating some of your gardens harvest and storing it in glass containers avoid putting hot food in plastic storage containers or heating foods packaged in plastic in the microwave plastics are significantly more inclined to leach chemicals when heated experts recommend keeping plastics out of the dishwasher too 
by following the above measures it can go a very long way in ensuring that you do not consume chemicals that are risky to your health

"abdullah muhammad almuhaysini a senior al qaedalinked cleric and the religious leader of jeish alfatah terrorist group admitted that the militants in syria have received financial and military aid from saudi arabia and certain other persian gulf arab states  shares
   
according to the syrian dissidents news website enab muhaysini has released a video recently in which he appreciated riyadh and other arab states for equipping his comrades with missiles
the saudi preacher said that the missiles that they have sent would be used to break the syrian army and its allies siege of aleppo
he also thanked turkey for supporting the terrorists and treating the wounded militants in its hospitals
jaish alfatah is a conglomerate of terrorist groups with alnusra fatah alsham front comprising its main body
in relevant remarks in june a source said that saudi arabia has sent new cargoes of weapons and financial aid to the terrorists in aleppo in northern syria to strengthen them against the syrian army and its allies fresh attacks
more why do we only hear of the humanitarian crisis in aleppo and not everywhere else in syria is maintaining assad the least worst option the criminal wests state sponsorship of terrorism israel wants syria destroyed as presaged by the oded yinon plan the saudi regime has recently sent small arms and new equipment including  drones to the terrorists in syria the source said
to this end riyadh has sent one of its ranking officers to the regions controlled by terrorists in northern aleppo to supply them with money and arms to intensify attacks and open new fronts against the syrian army and popular forces the source added
also a prominent syrian military analyst said earlier this month that the terrorists in aleppo take orders from outside and dont dare to leave the city in anticipation of punishment by saudi arabia and turkey
violation of the ceasefire by the terrorists and their opposition to the evacuation of aleppo is of no surprise as they are not the ones in charge of the decisionmaking for remaining or leaving the city rather they take orders from the regional and international sides for whom they are working turki hassan told fna last saturday
noting that the main cause of the terrorists stubborn stay in aleppo is that leaders of fatah alsham formerly known as alnusra front and ahrar alsham are afraid of punishment by their qatari saudi and turkish masters he said if they move in defiance of their qatari saudi and turkish lords they might be killed and their properties be seized",0

conspiracy theories have swirled in recent days as to why fbi director james comey reopened hillarys email investigation after just closing it back in july concluding that although hillary had demonstrated gross negligence in her establishment of a private email server that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her democrats after lavishing comey with praise for months on concluding his investigation in an impartial way have since lashed out at him for seeking to influence the  election cycle with hillary herself describing his recent actions as deeply troubling republicans on the other hand have praised comeys recent efforts as an attempt to correct a corrupt investigation that seemingly ignored critical evidence while granting numerous immunity agreements to clinton staffers 

according to the daily mail  and a source close to james comey the decision at least in part came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi who felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 
james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director 

the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades shares family outings with him and accompanies him to catholic mass every week 

some people including department heads stopped talking to jim and even ignored his greetings when they passed him in the hall said the source they felt that he betrayed them and brought disgrace on the bureau by letting hillary off with a slap on the wrist 

according to the source comey fretted over the problem for months and discussed it at great length with his wife patrice 

he told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom 

the people he trusts the most have been the angriest at him the source continued and that includes his wife pat she kept urging him to admit that he had been wrong when he refused to press charges against the former secretary of state though were sure there are many facets behind comeys decision making process we can all be quite certain at this point that hes not motivated by a desire to make friends having now alienated just about everyone in washington both in law enforcement and in both political parties in fact after tim kaine just last week praised comey as a wonderful career public servant with the highest standards of integrity

the bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily its not a question of trump it is an imperative that hillary be defeated if the people choose hillary then they must and will be punished wikileaks bill clinton boasts of hillarys working relationship with muslim brotherhood by john hayward breitbart  october   
in a speech bill clinton gave at the home of mehul and hema sanghani in october  revealed to the public for the first time by wikileaks former president bill clinton touted hillary clintons working relationship with the muslim brotherhoods mohamed morsi in egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillspresident clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures 
finally we live in a world as i said thats full of good news and bad news the united states cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening you cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way even the people who dont like the iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions hillary negotiated those sanctions and got china and russia to sign off  something i thought shed never be able to do i confess im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me i didnt think she could do it the chinese and the russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race 
and when the muslim brotherhood took over in egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between israel and hamas in gaza which on top of what was going on in syria and the inaudible jordan would have been a calamity for the world 
and when we were trying to reset our relations with russia under president medvedev she and her team negotiated a new start treaty which limits warheads and missiles and she lobbied it through the senate she had to get  votes which means a lot of these republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season they trusted her and she got it passed you cant get  votes in the senate without a lot of republican support and i dont know about you but with all this tension and mr putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in syria i think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the russians she did that 
youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the iran debacle than bill clinton boasting that the sanctions barack obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree 
mr clintons version of the iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as russias keen financial interest in keeping iranian energy out of the european market and chinas desire to use iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip 
but the part about the muslim brotherhood is most interesting if anything he is selling hillary clintons working relationship with egyptian islamists short because she used american diplomatic leverage for morsis benefit even before he got elected warning egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postmubarak campaign when morsi was running against a former member of hosni mubaraks military there have long been rumors that more subtle forms of us  pressure  were used to secure morsis office as well 
then again in public pronouncements clinton called hosni mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her obama administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door 
a few days ago declassified state department documents revealed clintons talking points for a  meeting with morsi hailed his election as a milestone in egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the muslim brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the us government and private sector to support his economic and social programs 
clinton was also supposed to privately offer morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly 
after morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist that is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the obama administration was saying while the arab spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but americaaligned or at least americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long 
as for clintons superb working relationship with morsi that eventually ended with morsis wife railing against clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from clinton to morsi that would damage the former us secretary of state meanwhile mohammed morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the egyptian penitentiary system  
egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of hillary clintons support for the muslim brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the  us presidential election therefore a prospective president hillary clinton probably wont suffer too much from secretary of state hillary clintons appalling lapses in judgment

"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton 
note how the media is spinning this as comeys drastic course of action while lynch is just being a responsible public servant the default assumption is that comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public",1
"anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage for tens of thousands of years when boys hit the age of puberty they were forced to undergo a set of challenges
these challenges were meant to break them down and build them back up even stronger these challenges were meant to test them as men and they are collectively known as an initiation or as a rite of passage when a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him he became a man
our society for the most part lacks these rites of passage this is in large part why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men we have all of these  year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the west
despite this however i believe that learning game is a form of initiation it contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man it teaches boys to develop selfconfidence  despite what women think of them to become decisive and assertive and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will
death of the ego 
one of the primary functions of a rite of passage is that it destroys a boys ego this is necessary for in order for him to become a man his identification with boyhood must be destroyed in other words he must cease to view himself as a boy and come to view himself as a man
this is in a nutshell what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion one rite of passage of the aborigines to be specific entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother
when a boy would reach the age of puberty the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show screaming and fighting to make it seem realistic the men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods
he would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time this sudden yanking from the motherworld of safety and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges symbolized his death as a boy
when the boy returned home he would view himself as a man he would carry himself taller he would interact with the women differently and he would have a new sense of purpose in many ways as i will soon explain game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it
facing fears 
many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears fear of death fear of the unknown and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage as an example one native american rite of passage involved making a boy sit blindfolded on a tree trunk for three days straight
imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling the cawing and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men then add in the elements of cold and wind the bugs that must have crawled over his feet and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been
then once three days had passed a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold this again is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight he was blind and helpless then his vision returned and he emerged a new man
all throughout the rites of passage of history whether they be of the inuits the amazon tribes or the south african tribes there are some very common characteristics facing your fear being reborn and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations
why were these rituals necessary 
upon contemplation it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary the world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in a tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military or safety if the men could not protect the tribe it would not be protected
imagine right now if a marauding band of  vandals roamed into your neighborhood they were all extremely jacked mean looking and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat a stick or a crowbar do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off
you being a reader of rok may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors i seriously doubt that a purplehaired complaining selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this
now try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors it was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle but being trained for battle requires more than physical strength
it requires ferocity it requires strength of will decisiveness assertiveness and a complete lack of fear these are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed for without them a tribe would go extinct
are these rituals still necessary 
someone might point out that we arent at war anymore so these rituals arent necessary although i agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore i still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary heres why
men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this no matter how hard the marxists cry and clamor men and women are different boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves namely a tribe boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it because there isnt even a world of men anymore
the once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere the freemasons and various other spiritual organizations it used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere but theyve become a thing of the past
this is why in large part were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore we dont have any healthy male role models all weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms we want more but we dont get more
any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto theres no chance for us to prove ourselves theres no dragons to slay no enemies to fight off and no fears to overcome
and were suffering we can feel it in our bones not only are men unnecessary but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past we dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe no obstacles to face
learning game the new initiation 
i believe that although it isnt perfect game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did
destroys your ego requires you to face your fears forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty develops confidence ferocity and a strong will again obviously game isnt perfect one could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think and i agree  but do you know what you may get into game for womens approval but any seasoned player knows that you actually stay in the game for your own personal growth
when men first start learning game they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be they think that learning game will get them girls and it does but something happens along the waythey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level
game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety and to live life fearlessly  by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life
learning game creates a wholepersonality transformation that cannot be found anywhere else no other hobby outlet or activity will change you as much as game does aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past
game makes you a man 
game will transform you from a boy into a man for a vast number of reasons first off game demolishes your ego  a lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls
this is why so many men hate game and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly and most men cant take this when you start to go out and learn game you have one of two choices
accept that you suck with girls and keep trying to improve viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection most men choose the latter their ego is far too precious and they cant handle it being challenged those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego however will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined take my word for it
second learning game requires you to face your fears think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life of course so once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life in other words youre starting to develop a totally new personality that isnt afraid of living life and taking risks
game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty a lot of the time in fact most of the time you dont know whether or not a girls friends will be okay with you you dont know if she has a boyfriend you dont know if she lives nearby you dont know this you dont know that when it comes to game theres a lot of uncertainty
this is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it what other skill could be more masculine the men of the past revered this skill because its what their entire livelihood was based around
you see a pack of deer  feet away you dont know if you can kill them or not should you take the risk an enemy tribe is attacking should you run to your hut and get a better weapon or pick up a rock and do what you can youre injured and alone but you see a nearby village should you ask them for help would they kill you or heal you
learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia his life depended on it now the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other more extreme measures such as fighting in a war or something although even then you wont have much freedom to make decisions
all in all game will take you from a boy to a man it will teach you to be confident and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women it will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration
most importantly however it will teach you to overcome your fears in the words of my favorite pickup mentor learning game is an odyssey of the mind it teaches you to overcome your fears to face your lingering negative beliefs and to grow as a man our society gives us no right of passage so weve created our own go out and learn game for it will change your life

"poll sexism was not a factor in hillarys loss by aaron bandler november   
some leftists still reeling from hillary clintons stunning defeat on tuesday are blaming her defeat on supposed sexism against a woman president however a new poll suggests that sexism did not play a role at all in clintons loss 
the poll conducted by conquest communications group and published on just facts  featured a question specifically geared toward gauging potential sexism if you were faced with a choice between a male and a female presidential candidate who would you vote for 
here were the results emphasis added 
overall  of voters said it does not matter  preferred a female  preferred a male  were unsure and  refused to answer 
male voters and trump voters were more likely than any other groups to say it does not matter at  and  respectively the other groups were not far behind and within the margins of error with rates of  for clinton voters  for undecided voters  for females 
naturally supporters of trump were more likely to support a male president than a female president percent to  percent respectivelyand clinton supporters were more likely to support female president than a male president  percent to  percent respectively 
the survey was conducted from october  so it was taken a couple of weeks before the election but its hard to imagine a majority of voters all of a sudden turned into a bunch of sexists 
there is a little bias towards a male president among trump voters and a little bias towards a female president among clinton voters but the results of the survey suggest that overall the genitalia of a candidate is not a significant factor involved in most voters when it comes to choosing the next president of the united states 
democrats will have to find a different strategy for identity politics since the gender card doesnt work speaking of identity politics it looks like the race card seems to be in trouble as well  tags",1

"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

" hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts  hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from  and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what 
i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward  to kill a mockingbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham 
this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing 
this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character 
the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before 
im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks 
these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth 
these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war 
i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them 
be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud 
supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance 
and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them 
in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film 
and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british 
despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly 
please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder 
there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  
and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them 
in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide 
the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best 
what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following 
with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works 
which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in  and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman 
i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint 
as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much 
simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood 
gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him 
of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life 
the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it 
hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners 
the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality 
doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs 
so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases 
by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more",1

julian assange claims that hillary clintons campaign used hackers to attack wikileaks servers wikileaks editorinchief says that despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in us elections his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over 
via yournewswire sponsored links 
everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday scroll down for video below 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month more wikileaks has activated contingency plans after assange s internet link was intentionally cut off httpstcooctsmseme 
 rt rt_com october   
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters we were fastest on podestaemails  faster than wikileaks  and the us conspiracy machine cant handle it httpstconjaaeqdd 
 rt rt_com october   
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said 
assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing what in their mind is white trash",0

sioux falls ia  during his  presidential campaign bill clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of tom bradys family dairy farm 
the family farm which was owned by tom bradys father at the time willow brady jr was often visited by the clinton family when they were in the area 
my dad and bill clintons step dad were like brothers they often visited us on the holidays when i was a kid bill even knew the cows names by heart that always surprised me recalls the yearold thirdgeneration dairy farmer 
 my father was a strong democratic party supporter all his life and a big bill clinton fan so i never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away  
sex drugs and cattle 
during the  iowa caucus the clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the bradys farm a night tom brady says he will never forget 
the clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs thats when everything went wrong he recalls visibly distraught by the whole affair 
i dont know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women but i sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because i was there and i saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me its not something id wish my worst enemy to live to see he told local reporters

a generation ago the communist tyranny in cuba demanded that the united nations condemn america for the embargo the brutal castro regimes rant accused the united states of threatening nuclear annihilation countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
on a cold day in october the european leftwing activist serving as un ambassador announced to applause that her administration would no longer be voting to defend the us at the un 
un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain samantha power said 
thank you she added acknowledging the applause 
under obama the united states would no longer defend the united states a generation ago the communists had been in cuba now they were in washington dc 
instead of defending america obamas chosen representative agreed that our communist enemies had a point about our lack of human rights and our imperialist foreign policy 
let me be among the first to acknowledge  as our cuban counterparts often point out  that the united states has work to do in fulfilling these rights for our own citizens and we know that at times in our history us leaders and citizens used the pretext of promoting democracy and human rights in the region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy of mistrust she said 
if the cuban representative had been in her place he could not have done much better communist cuban propaganda was now being parroted by ambassador power if the castro dictatorship wanted to save money it could shut down its propaganda department and outsource the labor to washington dc 
the cuban ambassador boasted that cuban communists had rid ourselves of us imperialism and proclaimed that we will never go back to capitalism he declared that the resolution was a powerful message to the peoples of the world the message is indeed unmistakable 
ben rhodes the close obama adviser who sold the media on the iran sellout curtly tweeted his justification no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
who is this we 
the cuban embargo is the law of the land its the official policy of the united states its based on laws passed by congress and implemented by president john f kennedy and his successors 
this we certainly isnt the united states government its elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches working together to end the old policy and implement a new one 
one member of the we must be ben rhodes because he tells us so who is rhodes an aspiring novelist who pushed obama to back the muslim brotherhood takeover of egypt the iran nuke sellout and now apparently choosing communist cuba over america 
no one has ever elected rhodes to anything but under leftwing rule he outweighs congress president kennedy the law of the land and the national interests of the united states 
we is obama who made the final decision its ambassador samantha power its a number of other functionaries all of whom derive their power from a single elected official who is only one third of the government this is the we that announced its treasonous opposition to the us at the un 
america has a we problem 
if the we of the american left wants to vote its own way it should secede to form its own country 
when president john f kennedy proclaimed the embargo on all trade with cuba he based it on authorization from the congress of the united states that is how our system used to work 
these days el teleprompte in dc decides that he wants to sign a nuclear treaty with iran mandate transgender bathrooms legalize millions of illegal aliens or open relations with his brother tyrant in havana and he does so on his own authority and congress is dismissed as a bunch of obstructionists 
thats not how america is supposed to work thats how iran works thats how cuba works 
the first word in the introduction to obamas presidential policy directive on cuba after the date was i obamas basis for his authority is his  announcement letat cest moi obama is the state 
jfk no humble shrinking violet mentions i only in the fourth paragraph after congress what is the context of kennedys i now therefore i john f kennedy president of the united states of america acting under the authority of section a of the foreign assistance act of  
the i of jfk can only act as a servant not a master 
in obamas directive congress exists only to be berated or badgered for its obstructionism there is no source of authorization for anything other than barack obama there is no law only obama 
now the big we in washington have decided that they will oppose america at the united nations but ben rhodes who aspires to excel at novelistic narratives made an unfortunate slip obama has been accused of louis xivs letat cest moi mentality but ben rhodes isnt saying we are the state instead he tells us that there are two powerful political entities in america one is us the other is we 
we does not yet entirely control the state but we also feels no obligation to the united states if we agrees with america then we will vote with it at the un if we opposes america then we votes against it we will choose patriotism or treason based on its own interests not ours 
we happens to run america but it isnt america its the parasite humped on americas back 
you can call we by many names deep state is one its a coalition of leftwing special interests networking through politics the nonprofit sector and media corporations to control america 
president kennedy was quite familiar with the enemy  we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influenceon infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of elections on intimidation instead of free choice 
kennedy was speaking after the recent bay of pigs crisis the foreign assistance act mentioned by him was passed by congress that year while the cuban embargo limited the ability of the castro regime to sponsor and spread terror around the region and the world it didnt stop the we in washington dc 
it is easy to sit here in the distant future of  and wonder whether cuba matters at all but the truth is that we are still enmeshed in the same fundamental struggle of the cold war that struggle did not end when the berlin wall fell it is a battle over whether nations will be ruled by we the people or by the nameless we of the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy of the nomenklatura of the left 
by backing away from america at the united nations the we have announced their independence from the laws responsibilities and duties of the country whose government they have hijacked 
but the we offer us no such independence from their treasonous rule instead they impose on us the collectivism of yevgeny zamyatins novel we in which everyone suffers under the stifling progressive tyranny of the one state that controls every aspect of human life that novel inspired  
what we offer us is what cubas castro wes one state and every communist regime offer us its what george orwell in  summed up as a boot stamping on a human face  forever 
president kennedy dated his embargo proclamation from the one hundred and eightysixth year of the independence of the united states of america at the united nations ambassador power cheerfully declared americas enforced submission to the communist demands for cuba 
the cuban people show no signs of winning independence from their communist overlords the question is will the united states of america be able to regain its independence from the we",1

"fbi releases files on bill clintons cash for pardons scandal november   daniel greenfield 
the fbi has an early present for hillary clinton its the files from the time her husband decided to pardon a wanted fugitive in exchange for cash that fugitive was a fellow by the name of marc rich his prosecutor james comey 
the fbi unexpectedly released  pages of documents related to an investigation closed without charges in  into president bill clintons pardon of marc rich who had been married to a wealthy democratic donor 
the unusual timing of the release was the result of a freedom of information act request that had been completed and was posted under standard fbi practice according to a law enforcement official who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters but the clinton campaign immediately questioned the timing of the release 
well of course it did its never especially wise to pick fights with people who have a lot of dirt on you 
the investigation stemmed from one of several pardons clinton made on the last day of his presidency in  that of financier and international fugitive marc rich whose exwife denise had given to the democratic national committee and the entity that would later become the clinton foundation 
and theres a surprise guest 
while the files may seem dated they invoke figures beyond the clintons who went on to play key roles in official washington  including comey 
he served as prosecutor in charge of a legal case against rich from  to  as the us attorney in manhattan in  comey took over a criminal investigation of clintons pardons i was stunned at the rich pardon comey wrote in a letter to lawmakers in  
clintons people are fuming but it was a standard fioa request and theres nothing big here its just one of those things the clintons should have gone to jail for but didnt another of those",1

its time to get excited because marvel comics just announced a new superhero that advances diversity in comics in a major way the series is called luminary  and it tells the story of a mildmannered caucasian man named percy pendleton who gains incredible superhuman powers and constantly expresses his regret that he was blessed with those abilities instead of a latina woman who could be a role model for young hispanic girls in addition to merely fighting crime 
yes marvel deserves major kudos for this massive step toward inclusive representation in comics 
while working as a nuclear physicist at stark industries percy is caught in a particleaccelerator explosion a surge of neutrinos floods his nervous system and transforms him into the incredible luminary a hero whose amazing powers of flight super strength and energy manipulation make him concerned that as a white man he does nothing to reflect the face of a changing america which is increasingly hispanic and female 
wow what a longoverdue breath of fresh air to see a bigname publisher like marvel feature a white male superhero who thinks its a shame he isnt latina 
for a glimpse of the groundbreaking work you can look forward to in luminary  check out these sample panels marvel released earlier this week 
awesome thanks marvel for proving that white men who wish latinas had better opportunities can be superheroes too we cant wait to read the first issue",0

iran says its exports of natural gas to turkey that have been halted reportedly as a result of an explosion inside the turkish territory will resume within the next few days 
sadeq akbarpour the head of gas exports measurement facilities at iranturkey border told the domestic media that the required coordination is being carried out with the turkish botas company to resume irans exports by next monday 
akbarpour emphasized that iran is ready to supply turkey with its required gas whenever it voices its readiness 
majid bojarzadeh the spokesman of the national iranian gas company nigc also told irans shana news agency that ankara had informed tehran of a problem in the pipeline that carried iranian gas into turkey on thursday night 
furthermore majid aqababaei the director general for border affairs of irans interior ministry acknowledged as reported by shana that an explosion near irans border had caused the problem 
iran is turkeys second supplier of gas after russia providing onefifth of the countrys consumption the current volume of natural gas that iran is piping to its northwestern neighbor is  million cubic meters per day mcmd officials in tehran had already emphasized that the islamic republic is ready to increase its gas exports to turkey by  mcmd

"desperate obama rips comey we dont operate on innuendo by november   
barack obama must be pretty worried 
earlier this week white house press secretary josh earnest told the media that fbi director james comeys decision to reopen an investigation into hillary clinton didnt spring from bias or politics he explained  
director comey is a man of integrity and principle and well regarded by officials in both parties and served as a senior position in the bush administration and got bipartisan support when his nomination to be director of the fbi was considered by the united states senate they speak to his good character and the presidents assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is trying to influence the outcome of the election and the president doesnt believe hes secretly supporting a candidate or political party hes in a tough spot hes the one who will be in the position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including officials who served in senior justice position for presidents led by both parties 
now with the polls closing to within the margin of error president obama has had second thoughts he told nowthisnews  
i do think that there is a norm that when there are investigations we dont operate on innuendo and we dont operate on incomplete information and we dont operate on leaks we operate based on concrete decisions that are made when this was investigated thoroughly last time the conclusion of the fbi the conclusion of the justice department the conclusion of repeated congressional investigations was she had made some mistakes but that there wasnt anything there that was prosecutable 
its worthwhile pointing out the hypocrisy here  obamas entire administration has been built on innuendo his department of justice has destroyed police departments around the country with unsubstantiated innuendo about systemic racism his irs used innuendo to destroy conservative cs his entire  campaign was rooted in innuendo about mitt romneys supposed secret evils 
but more than anything the obama flip here shows serious desperation what changed the polls on monday it looked like the fbi scandal would detract from hillarys polling numbers but wouldnt kill her now it looks like she might go down in flames this shows how faithless obama is  comey was wonderful just up until the point he threatened hillarys chances at which point he became a slanderer trafficking in innuendo 
if comey has any stones he should resign in protest at obamas accusations hes already been thrown under the bus by his commanderinchief for not playing dead for him long enough to move hillary into the white house hes got no future in his position no matter what he does it would be a final redeeming move of honor to tell obama and his cronies to stuff it now tags",1

"interviews the fbi probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar says american analyst scott bennett 
the ongoing federal investigation into the clinton foundation was expected because of the clinton familys ties with us enemies says scott bennett a former us army psychological warfare officer 
the fbi has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it fox news reported wednesday citing informed officials 
bennett told press tv on friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar and many other countries blacklisted by washington 
it was revealed on friday that the clinton foundation took a  million gift from qatar during hillary clintons tenure as the us secretary of state without her informing the state department 
hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state 
according to the foundations website qatar has so far given the clintons a total of between  million and  million over the years 
aside from qatar saudi arabia has also been one of the clinton foundations biggest donors it became known in  that the kingdom had given them between  million and  million 
so those terrorist entities which have been labeled as the enemies of the united states have been appearing as clinton foundation donors bennett said 
that is a serious crime it is treason it is corruption it is bribery of officials said the analyst 
bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the clinton family were coming from those personnel in the american government who have had enough 
they have stepped up they have released emails they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to wikileaks he added 
whistleblowing website wikileaks has released thousands of hillarys campaign chairman and top aide john podestas emails since last month exposing some of the wellkept secrets surrounding the clinton family and hillary clintons bid for the white house 
bennett predicted that the case would most probably lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend loading",1

"south africa 
issues surrounding a minimum wage bill education and services are being utilized in attempts to overthrow the african national congress 
south african president jacob zuma has come out publically to state that there are efforts underway by the west to undermine the african national congress anc government which has held power for over  years 
a myriad of challenges are facing the south african ruling party including an economic recession the bringing of several allegations about corruption within the office of the presidency a declining stock market and national currency along with increasingly worsening relations with the united states 
in africa there are numerous examples from the postcolonial period of the last five decades where the intelligence and military apparatuses of the imperialist states have sought to reverse the forward progress of the masses of workers farmers youth and their leadership in the recent period in the south american state of brazil the first woman president dilma rousseff of the workers party was forcefully removed from office in a political coup 
in addition to the decline in the south african economy largely due to the overall world crisis which has driven down commodity prices and systematically disinvested from the emerging states there has been a fracturing of the national democratic movement and the workers organizations over contentious debates surrounding a way forward in an october report delivered at the world federation of trade unions wftu  th congress in durban south africa dr blade nzimande the secretary general of the south african communist party sacp placed these contradictions inside the national democratic revolution and the largest trade union federation the congress of south african trade unions cosatu within a broader context of the desire by the imperialist states to reverse the advances of the liberation struggles 
in a recent article published by the agence france press afp president zuma emphasized that western powers want to remove the anc because they do not want the anc to develop relations with those countries which helped the party in the antiapartheid struggle this statement was made by president zuma on nov  laid the blame directly on certain western countries which do not wish the ruling african national congress success 
zuma spoke to anc supporters at a rally in bushbuckridge mpumalanga province that the imperialist states were utilizing some anc members to further their agenda adding that some party members had been won over to the views of western countries the president said that those anc members calling for his resignation were in fact serving the interests of the western states 
the political economy of destabilization 
since  there have been substantial reforms initiated under the anc government there has been the construction of housing for the poor and working class the expansion of healthcare the breaking down of racial barriers in public facilities along with access to household utilities and clean drinking water 
however the fundamental relations and ownership of production remains under the control of the capitalist class as a manifestation of modernday capitalism high unemployment rising costs of living including education fees as well as problems associated with service delivery have continued 
in all other countries the majority controls everything from politics economy and defense    its only in this country south africa where we dont have economic freedom its controlled by the minority and those who oppressed us zuma stressed afp nov  
the president went on to say that is why they are scared that we will take away this economy they want to take away the strength of the anc because they know the anc is the only organization trying to balance the scales 
zuma said that his government would not break ties with longtime friends internationally in order to win the approval of the imperialist governments the president had also spoke at the wftu  th congress noting that the capitalist system would not relinquish concessions to the working class without demands based upon mass struggle 
recounting the history of the national liberation movement in south africa zuma said socialist countries like russia and china helped the anc giving it military training and aid during the antiapartheid struggle the socialist countries came to our aid it was russia who trained us and helped us with the tools to fight china and other socialist countries helped us

debate surrounds a national minimum wage amid allegation of regime change agenda 
the anc government has proposed the adoption of a national monthly minimum wage of  rand which is approximately  us dollars  percent of the working population earns less than this proposed amount bbc nov  
despite the possible introduction of such legislation it falls far short of what is actually needed to maintain a basic household prof chris malikane of the university of witwatersrand in johannesburg suggested that  rand per month was essential in maintaining a decent home bbc nov  
this issue is controversial among the business interests which claim that any significant governmentmandated increase in the minimum wage would create further unemployment which stands officially at around  percent over the last few years there have been largescale job losses in the mining sector which is impacting economic recovery 
two years ago cosatu proposed a minimum wage of  rand per month with inflation since  the amount would be at least  today 
deputy president cyril ramaphosa said the  rand per month figure was decided by a panel of experts ramaphosa said we are now a step closer to finalizing discussions on the national minimum wage all social partners will now decide what their take is bbc nov  
the anc must address the issues of joblessness poverty and service delivery in order to win back its twothirds majority electoral base inside the country local governmental elections which were held in august saw a decline in support for the ruling party by approximately ten points although it remains by far the most popular party in south africa winning  percent of the votes in the august poll 
a commission report issued several weeks ago alleged that the government of president zuma has been involved in corruption zuma has denied the charges and attempts to pass motions of noconfidence in parliament failed on numerous occasions the current anc leadership seems solidly committed to keeping zuma in office until his term expires in  
the party maintains that washington through its embassy in pretoria is pursuing a regimechange agenda party spokesperson zize kodwa stated in march they have taken about  young people to america to train them as part of their leadership program what we got from those young people is not what they expected they were trained on how to destabilize the country and regime change xinhua news agency march ",0

dr baehr added the opening is powerful the ending is heartrending the drama the acting the jeopardy work well throughout the whole movie this is one of the few movies that movieguide can actually say go see it keith harris and nick edwards as wynn and sammy heller 
hero opens with joe played by burgess jenkins coaching his son davids baseball team the gappers to the state championship seven years later after pursuing his dream job joe returns to town he had left to pursue fame and fortune to support the family his wife hannah is stricken with cancer while david is angry that joe left them after hannahs funeral joe moves back into the house but david remains bitter meanwhile david is coaching the now hapless gappers the team loses more than it wins joe steps in to get other fathers involved with their sons and turn the team of losers into winners hoping this gesture will help joe reconcile with david unfortunately the league rules have softened dramatically making it nearly impossible to train the team properly practice times are limited coaches cant make players take laps around the field everyone gets a participation trophy the beloved american pastime has become so boring that few parents show up for games let alone practices so joe starts his own league to turns things around 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball

what makes hero particularly compelling today is that it addresses the growing crisis of absentee fathers and its impact on baseball itself 
watch the trailer 
washington times reporter bradford richardson wrote in his article study blames absent fathers for decline in black baseball players that the austin institute a texasbased think tank focused on family and societal issues has commissioned a study titled called out at home which shows a correlation between the decline of black fatherhood and the drop in black participation in baseball 
from the director of isaiah  judgment and the producer of alone not yet alone comes hero a beautiful tale of the significance of the fatherchild relationship thats and set around americas pastime baseball 
richardson writes 
kevin stuart executive director of the austin institute said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch 
there is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball mr stuart said pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams 
baseball he said was made to be played by fathers and sons 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball 
famous fatherson tandems  including ken griffey sr and ken griffey jr prince fielder and cecil fielder and tony gwynn sr and tony gwynn jr  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball farah said 
baehr concluded hero is a wonderful faithfilled sports drama it will touch your heart your mind and your soul gapper team dads from the film every boy needs a hero",1
"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  pm that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released   
coming from people who believe in something called spiritual warfare a nebulous spiritual struggle taking place over and above all the talk about issues and policy positions  it is perhaps no surprise that the religious right should declare that their messiah  donald trump  is being threatened with witchcraft 
lance wallnau whose twitter page claims to be your spiritual warfare guide to the  election appeared on the jim bakker show to push the crazy idea that many christians feel this fog on their head at times and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
watch courtesy of right wing watch 
oh sweet baby jesus the mighty lance has struck out what has happened of course is that the religious right not only endorsed but anointed a candidate who embodies the exact opposite of the values they claim to champion its no wonder they feel in a fog  metaphorically or physically theyre selling their souls 
wallnau claims the left is a smaller number of radicals better organized than the larger body of christ who doesnt work together and thats the dilemma that americas in right now even though the left is a disparate alliance of various groups working together and the religious right has been organizing since goldwater lost in   
a hypocrite just cant catch a break it seems 
the web literally is coming down on america and whats sad is how many christians feel this fog on their head at times do you feel that its almost like everythings going wrong we dont realize its a remnant operating strategically through organizations that are intent on shifting the american culture and discipling the country and that fog thats on christians is the collective witchcraft that comes over the body of christ because theres spirits being authorized to be released 
wherever theres agreement theres power the more unbelievers agree with the narrative that theyre hearing the more power and authorization satan has to manifest so unless the church has an exposure of what the enemys doing and begins to agree together with a counterstrategy were going to deal with more and more fog and the worst part iswe dont have to surrender nations to the devil 
so if you disagree with wallnau if you oppose trump it can only because youre manifesting the power of satan who in the old testament is gods lieutenant not his adversary so pick your testament i suppose 
lance wallnau insists he is not a big conspiracy theorist buff but this doesnt do anything to convince us hes not some wackadoodle instead this is nothing new as a nonchristian being told that you represent a devil you dont even believe exists 
there are  years of history backing up the accusation and testifying to its usefulness for religious zealots hoping to delegitimize or worse their opponents 
without charges of satanism and witchcraft you dont have the genocide of european and middle eastern paganism you dont have antijewish pogroms and you dont have the crusades or the spanish inquisition you dont have witchburnings 
what this sort of nonsense illustrates for liberals and progressives is that were not fighting on the same battleground as our opponents 
not only do they deal in a conspiracyladen world a world free of facts but a world in which what might be hiding under your bed or in your closet has real power and reason  and lets go ahead and say sanity  do not 
lets face it donald trumps biggest enemy is not satan but donald trump himself and wallnau can claim believers have an edge all they want but all the belief in the world wont overturn reality",1
"alain soral is an influential frenchswiss thinker author and filmmaker his beliefs are summarized as french third position basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views and there have been third position movements in many european countries over the past several decades
major beliefs of sorals ideology include nationalism political sovereignty social conservatism antiglobalism antiimmigration antifeminism antibankster and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy a major slogan of third position is reconciliation between the labor left and the values righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism
early life 
alain soral was born in  in southeastern france he attended a wellregarded private catholic school before enrolling in the distinguished national school of fine arts in paris founded in  and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist cornelius castoriadis a famous th century thinker
castoriadis 
castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty what god has commanded is what we must institute with the law
modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law
castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary
the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom this would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary
postuniversity 
soral loved books and knowledge studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum he was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the pua movement was virtually unknown he developed a skill at attracting young narcissistic valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women and published a book on game in  his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs
he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy
he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike of the bobos and his camaraderie with the working man the communist party along with the front national were among the few opponents of the creation of the eu soral studied the works of marx and other marxists before leaving to join the far right front national where he was a speechwriter for marie le pen he noted that both communists and front national members were strongly nationalistic and indeed many workers left the communist party to join fn around this time

he became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay feminist and islamist or other racial multicultural groups after front national performed poorly in the  elections he formed equality and reconciliation  seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism patriarchy anticommunism antiimmigration and antizionism er is an alternative news site with some tendencies to the american altright pronationalist and critical of modern culture and feminism he describes it as left for the workers and right for morals
he is a boxer and since  has coached boxing he records videos has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media
summary of views trolling a feminist
not much is available in english of soral and even english subtitles on his many videos are hard to find i have but a cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are
antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men
anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity
antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates
antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews
anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls communitarianism a poison opposed to ethnic racial sexual islamist or feminist communitarianism which is opposed to morality and national standards opposes the public effeminate homo and transsexual society and laments the lack of strong male role models makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the gay pride community movement which promotes drag queens parties vulgar parades and hypersexualization
antivulgarity opposes vulgar language dress and speech especially in women has said he prefers publicly wearing the muslim veil to thong underwear would go crazy at a slutwalk critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty
islam feels the menace of islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of islam to foster animosity between social groups to possibly create a clash of civilizations or world war leading to a full globalist takeover and to loot mideast nations and that the fundamental values of moderate islam are perfectly compatible with french moderate catholic views
antimodern culture and mainstream media opposed to the decline in western values and culture and the sorry state of mainstream media who has labeled him a pariah
le neo masculinité 
many likeminded red pill men are turned off by the leftright politics in america the third position combines right views on nation morality and law with some left positions on social issues and economics i believe if both the left and right hate you you are probably doing something right the ideas here strongly resonate with neomasculinity sorals ideas are stimulating and interesting and definitely deserve further investigation
an excellent summary of soral and his beliefs is available here

by shane wright  voter fraud is a contentious issue of late liberals swear it is a myth propagated by evil racist conservatives we know better most on the right are aware of the voter fraud issue but many have little to no idea how to combat or report violations consider this your crash course first and foremost step one in any instance where you see or suspect voter fraud is to alert the state officials who oversee the election process for most states this is done by the secretary of state in other states there is a state board of elections notifying these officials is paramount as they are the ones who ultimately certify and authenticate elections alert them before you call fox news or blow up twitter though drawing as much media attention as possible is beneficial you want to make sure you follow a process i have included a contact list for each state at the bottom of this post in many cases once you have alerted the state authorities they will direct you to the proper city or county officials where you will fill out paperwork bureaucracy at its finest go ahead and jump through their hoops if you witnessed the fraud chances are someone else did too make a good effort to get other witness names and contact information as well this will strengthen your case and increase the likelihood that state and county officials will step in and act on your complaint if as has happened before state officials ignore you entirely your next step is to contact your state attorney general and alert them of the situation however before you do this you need to arm yourself with knowledge of your specific states election laws you will be more credible if you are able to cite the specific statutes which were violated state laws are generally published online however it may actually be quicker and easier for you to go to your local library or courthouse and utilize their search engines in my experience relevant case law and updated statutes can be difficult to sort through on google or other internet search sites the attorney general should conduct an investigation to determine whether or not there is enough evidence andor information to take legal action if state officials refuse to work with you your next step is to alert both your state representative and state senator they may intercede and it is in the secretary of state and attorney generals best interest to respond professionally and quickly to these representatives should you continue to hit dead ends on the state level its time to alert the department of justice before doing this call your congressman and senator in some cases they will be willing to write a letter on your behalf to the doj this is what your goal is ultimately for the doj is less likely to ignore these officials if going through your elected officials is a poor option as it may very well be depending on the circumstances review federal election law and proceed anyways finally you and i both know that the doj nor liberal state officials are likely to do anything about a claim of election fraud however it is absolutely imperative that you go through these motions and document these steps to preserve any future legal options documenting instances of election fraud will continue to strengthen our case for voter id furthermore it is important to press forward on these criminals so that its understood that we will not idly stand by and allow our elections to be manipulated last but not least use your head if you see or suspect voter manipulation have the courage to record it whip out your phone and start shooting video  and report it to the appropriate authorities first alabama,1

the fbi is examining how a hillary clinton aide handled emails the examination has nothing to do with the democratic nominee her emails or her email server 
according to newsweeks kurt eichenwald the scandal is related to the process clinton aide huma abedin used to print out emails for the then secretary of state to read 
eichenwald reported because clinton preferred to read documents on paper rather than on a screen emails and other files were often printed out and provided to her either at her office or home where they were delivered in a diplomatic pouch by a security agent abedin like many state department officials found the government network technology to be cumbersome and she had great trouble printing documents there investigative records show as a result she sometimes transferred emails from her unclassified state department account to either her yahoo account or her account on clintons server and printed the emails from there it is not clear whether she ever transferred official emails to the account she used for her husbands campaign 
abedin would use this procedure for printing documents when she received emails she believed clinton needed to see and when the secretary forwarded emails to her for printing abedin told the fbi she would often print these emails without reading them abedin printed a large number of emails this way in part because investigative records show other staff members considered her clintons gatekeeper and often sent abedin electronic communications they wanted the secretary to see 
the entire scandal is about how emails were printed it has nothing to do with how hillary clinton handled emails or classified information the investigation is related to how an aide printed emails for hillary clinton to read no wonder comey didnt provide more details in his letter to congress the details of what is being examined are an embarrassment to the fbi 
there is no evidence that clintons aide committed a crime for the printing of the emails to be deemed criminal there must be evidence that abedin intended to leak classified information there remains zero evidence of criminal activity 
the fbi examination of new emails is turning out to be one of the most overblown red herrings of the  election  and comeys behavior is a disgrace to the us intelligence community 
the new information destroys republican hopes that the new emails were the game changer that could save them from defeat  republicans may spend the remaining days pushing the emails but their behavior will be the hallmark of a desperate party that is facing a crushing defeat 
the emails wont change anything in  but they will give congressional republicans a reason to keep investigating hillary clinton in  and beyond in other words james comey is already delegitimizing hillary clintons potential presidency",1

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",1
"gentlemen donald j trump is the new presidentelect of the united states though a a few results may still be unclear trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin
pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since  and wisconsin since way back in  it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly  years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was  when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there
importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for trump for example counts so far show that some  of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support trump this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public
the clown candidate has beaten  more experienced republican challengers and now hillary clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history
as tonights results have shown plenty of trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for protrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush  wolf blitzer  jake tapper  jessica valenti  and brent budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding trump victory needs to be held
and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from trump the donald has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress  the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the  house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet
every powerful vested interest not only supported hillary but did everything they could to ruin trump yes its happening
did you see the last major hillary clinton rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncé jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support donald trump even longterm republicans who betrayed trump like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for hillary clinton
likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for hillary plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the clinton campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn
and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about  of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times  washington post  and huffington post  plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the  campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against donald trump over the last  months
all of these media elites have lambasted trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting hillary podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of clinton foundation donors in hillarys secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet trump has triumphed nonetheless
the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and clinton foundation with the rule of law will hillary now find herself stumbling into jail
inasmuch as the clinton campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president trump once he takes office trumps first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the clinton foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and hillary clintons campaign
the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill clinton during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into hillarys emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed hillary about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp
election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling donald trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result hillary clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned trump privately so whos the sore loser now
last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next  hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds
hail to the chief donald j trump

she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement

comey worried to fbi employees that his letter would be misunderstood but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all it is becoming difficult to look at comeys actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations 
the fbi director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the democratic nominee but can be used by her opponents for political purposes

american hackers recently broke into russias communications networks electrical grid and government systems in preparation for a retaliatory cyber strike should russian hackers meddle in the us election according to nbc news 
officials do not expect any major attacks on us infrastructure which would be tantamount to an act of war but they are concerned that russian hackers may meddle in the election by spreading false information the hacker guccifer   which officials and some cyber security experts believe is a front for russian intelligence  claimed they would be monitoring elections from inside the system 
the us preparations are no different than russia and chinas probing of us networks the penetration caused no damage to russia instead it was the equivalent of a military scouting mission cyber weapons could be deployed if the us suffered a significant attack but officials tell nbc news that is an unlikely scenario just to be sure though obama administration officials issued a backchannel warning to russia to stay out of the election

 john podesta kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

 podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show 

 both were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

 kadzik lobbied podesta  then wh chief of staff  to pardon his billionaire tax dodger fugitive client marc rich whose wife gave  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon fbi director james comey is now trying to do the right thing and correct the deed cleaning up the mud he and hillary clinton put all over the face of fbi agency by reopening hillary clintons case thanks to kemails linked to sex scandal of huma abedins husband anthony weiner and the mutiny of fbi agents who wont put up with comeys crap we are suppose to finally get justice 

but guess what doj assigned a clinton ally and john podestas very close friend peter kadzik to take charge of the new investigation 

in a letter to congress the doj writes that it will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible assistant attorney general peter j kadzik writes in letters to house and senate lawmakers 

who is peter kadzik 

according to an excellent article published by daily caller 

the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 

the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 


podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 

the postbenghazi dinner was attended by podesta kadzik superlobbyist vincent roberti and other wellplaced beltway fixtures 

kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 

in the trenches 

podesta and kadzik have a long history  one which has largely gone unnoticed during the ongoing clinton email scandal 

kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 

that history is cited by podesta in another email hacked from his gmail account 

in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 

podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 

podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 

kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 

to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   

a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 

the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 

on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library

the complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voters choice but in all reported cases the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them 
to my knowledge at this point we dont have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints of course theyre all looked into and thats why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official commented gannon 
the nc state board of election released the following statement regarding the complaints 
the nc state board of elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touchscreen voting machines in several counties 
similar reports have been made in recent elections and we take them very seriously 
we want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touchscreen machines accurately record voters selections 
touchscreen machines are tested thoroughly before each election they are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy if a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately if needed the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration and the voter may be moved to a different machine 
also each touchscreen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot as with paper ballots voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot on touchscreen machines voters also can review a realtime audit log that records all of their selections 
we urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials said kim westbrook strach executive director of the nc state board of elections",0
"richard w painter wrote in a new york times an oped the fbis job is to investigate not to influence the outcome of an election 
such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act which bars the use of an official position to influence an election that is why the fbi presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment 
and that is why on saturday i filed a complaint against the fbi with the office of special counsel which investigates hatch act violations and with the office of government ethics i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w bush and i never thought that the fbi could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations until this week 
this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority 
unless trump wins and republicans take control of congress director comey is going to have to answer for his decisions 
as the complaints pile up it looks like congressional testimony may be the least of james comeys future problems",1
"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap rené guénon young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world  chap rené guénon older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola 
show me more venal more insensitive more corrupt minds than those of the literate caste how many of them do you know whose virtue would still be uncorrupted who but them for over thirty years kept flooding us with a loosened morale a disdain for work a disgust of duty a disrespect for family who but the literary who dipped into secret funds more shamelessly than they did who seduced women softened the young excited the nation to more debauchery than they did who did abandon cowardly the princes after begging for their favours socalled men of letters always they run like harlots between the legitimate government and usurpers between monarchy and republic between politics and socialism between atheism and religion everything is good to them as long as they can make a profit and be fashionable out of it  pierrejoseph proudhon quoted by the following one pierrejoseph proudon 
compare for example seventeenth century writers with those of the eighteenth what a difference in tone and gait the former under a veneer of servility have the most noble and proud stance they do not pretend to reign they merely stand at their place recognize the place of a superior power beyond give themselves completely to their writing task dismiss the temptation of advertising and demonstrate their professional dedication on the other hand look at the voltaire diderot and the like they open well the era of intellectuals writing stooges as they are courtiers of princes they flatter and despise at the same timesomething they are forced to do as they want to usurp their power their courtier nature reveals in everything they do the whole eighteenth century both spiritual and plain on a scoundrel background is libertine and already pornographic such is the start of literary mercantilism people of letters make money out of their writings pretend to financial independence and they write garbage to flatter the opinion of their public  édouard berth les méfaits des intellectuels the misdeeds of the intellectuals introduction édouard berth disciple of proudhon

"how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday october   at  am 
how they could steal the election from trump even if he is announced the winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  there has been a great deal of talk recently about the rigging of elections trump talks about it and then the media accuses him of being a threat to democracy by refusing to accept the will of the voters nobody asks hillary if she will accept the will of the voters 
of course we know that our electoral system is unfair biased and even rigged at a variety of levels without going into detail the media which plays an absolutely crucial role in staging our elections has abandoned even the pretense of neutrality ballot access is unfair campaign finance is corrupt electronic voting machines are vulnerable voting by foreigners and dead people exists as does multiple voting by individuals 
but one massive threat has so far gone completely unmentioned the vulnerability of the electoral college to postelection shenanigans 
what people are not aware of is that under the constitution the president is not elected on november  the tuesday after the first monday in november is designated for congressional elections it just so happens that over the years all the states decided to have their electors to the electoral college selected by the voters on that day in the early days of the republic it was actually more common for state legislatures to select the electors and the constitution allows the state legislatures to determine how the electors are selected 
it is actually the electoral college that elects the president and that happens on the monday after the second wednesday in december which this year will be december  on this day the electors will meet in their respective state capitals to cast their ballots which will then be sent to washington to be opened by vice president biden before a joint session of congress on january  of next year some of you may remember the scene from michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes that elected president bush ironically denying the objections raised by some congressmen to floridas electoral votes which bush won over gore amidst the greatest of controversy 
so if this system is enshrined in the constitution what could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes into complete meltdown over the next week a trump victory on november  will likely be a narrow one in terms of the electoral college map one very plausible scenario has trump losing pennsylvania but winning the rest of the main battleground states plus one of maines congressional districts maine along with nebraska allow for electors to be elected on a congressional district basis rather than winnertakeall under this scenario  republican electors would be elected a bare majority while  democrat electors would be elected 
notice i did not say trump would get  electoral votes which is what we are used to hearing the fact is that the electoral votes are not cast until december  and there is no guarantee that every single one of the  republican electors would actually vote for trump do you remember a few months ago how alarmed we were at the prospect of supposed trump delegates to the republican national convention deserting trump and voting for cruz it was only that trump piled up such large victories in the final primaries that he had big enough majority of delegates to cause the never trump people in the republican establishment to give up on rigging the convention 
so who are these electors just as the method of electing the electors is left up to the states the method for nominating the candidates for the electoral college is also left up to the states some states allow the presidential candidates to nominate their own slate of electors presumably these people could be counted on to be loyal but in other states the partys slate of electors is chosen at state party conventions and even electoral district conventions 
as a young man i attended one such convention and had my name put into nomination as a democratic elector myself and the other three contenders then made short speeches to the convention the other three talked about being precinct captains or hardworking party volunteers then i gave a speech calling for the direct election of the president and the abolition of the electoral college i got a huge round of applause i would have easily won but as a matter of principle i withdrew my name from nomination 
the point of the story is that most of the electors are unknown to the public typically cogs in the party apparatus and not even necessarily highlevel ones and some of them may even be smoothtalking slicksters like me unknown to the party itself 
so how likely is it that one or more republican electors would betray trump such a person is known as a faithless elector and while faithless electors have never ultimately altered the outcome of a presidential election there have been  faithless electors in our history in fact faithless electors caused the congress to have to decide the  election for vice president 
it is true that about half the states have laws punishing faithless voters but in all but a few states the votes of faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would be after a close election the hillary people or the never trump people could bribe or pressure republican electors some of whom may not like trump anyway not to vote for trump they could vote for hillary they could vote for pence they could vote for anyone else or they could even abstain from voting 
then what happens if enough republican electors are cajoled into voting for hillary in the above  scenario it would only require two then hillary gets inaugurated on january  if its a tie then the house of representatives breaks the tie obviously there have been republican members of the house that say they wont vote for trump for president in november so there is no reason to assume they would vote for him in january 
however not only are republicans likely to retain a significant majority in the house but the voting for president by the house is not one vote for each representative but one vote per state this means that california which currently has  democratic representatives would get only one vote while alaskas single representative who is a republican would also get one vote this heavily favors the republicans and means that if hillary cannot flip enough republican electors to herself to win a majority of the electoral votes she is finished there is no real prospect of the house of representative electing hillary 
but what if enough republican electors vote for other people paul ryan for example so that no candidate gets a majority then the house of representatives gets to choose between the top three vote finishers in the electoral college vote you could get a coalition between democrats and republican defectors that would deny trump the presidency and give it to someone like ryan the same applies in the case that mormon excia operative and nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  which some polls predict is possible 
while none of the above scenarios may come to pass we do have to face the fact that the establishment has so far stopped at nothing to try to defeat trump and so it is not too far fetched to think that they would try these tactics especially if the november  voting produces a very narrow victory for trump the media could start inventing more reasons why trump is uniquely unfit to become president and claim that the constitution allows for these scenarios which is the case and that this in fact was why the framers of the constitution created the electoral college which is not the case 
it would then be incumbent on us to make it clear to the members of the electoral college and the congress that any violation of the peoples will would not be tolerated",1

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election 
reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true 
snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has",0
"cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party home  breaking news  breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke jay syrmopoulos november    comment 
washington dc  in what could prove to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of hillary clintons presidential ambitions an email released by wikileaks this morning  the th batch of emails from clinton campaign chair john podesta  reveals potential criminal intent to violate a court order for subpoenaed documents 
john podesta sent the message only hours after the new york times reported that clinton might have violated federal records requirements by using the server according to the latest batch of podesta emails released by wikileaks 
the email in question  sent by podesta on march   reveals the clinton campaign chair directing cheryl mills hillarys attorney and chief of staff to destroy emails that had already been subpoenaed 
the email exchange between podesta and mills came suspiciously on the same day that news broke regarding clintons use of a private email server 
after news of clintons private email server became public podesta wrote to mills not to sound like lanny but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later podesta told mills mills responded think you just got your new nick name 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what podesta meant by dump the emails when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking what this email does is provide insight into the coverup process  and exposes a willful intent to break the law additionally it reveals exactly how swiftly the clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike 
according to a report by the new york post  
in december  hillary clinton  now the democratic presidential nominee  turned over about  pages of workrelated email to the state department but that fact wasnt revealed until the times reported on her use of the private server 
on march    a week after the podestamills exchange  clinton addressed the email scandal and announced she had deleted about  personal emails 
the emails reference to lanny is likely in reference to lawyer lanny davis who served as special counsel to thenpresident bill clinton as well as spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters regarding campaignfinance investigations and other legal issues 
interestingly zero hedge reports that a search for lanny davis reveals a suspicious exchange between clinton campaign manager robby mook and podesta from march   just days after the above mentioned exchange in which mook tells podesta 
we gotta zap lanny out of our universe cant believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv 
hillarys team was apparently upset that bill clintons special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action and moved to zap lanny out of our universe 
while it isnt clearly spelled out exactly which emails podesta is referring to in his email the fact that he wrote better do so sooner than later on the day news broke publicly regarding clintons email server strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter 
clintons entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled and her methodical plan to strategically impede the state departmentfbi investigation by deleting the evidence is now on full display for the public to see 
hopefully wikileaks next upcoming podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email of course hillarys spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by clintons team to usurp a federal investigation

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks it is so likely that saudi king be tried according to experts the passing of jasta may cause international chaos especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september  the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations 
in late september united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law the justice against sponsors of terrorism act this law made ussaudi relation more chaotic 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasisacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies 
john kerry united states secretary of state showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk a few days ago kerry and adel aljubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests he said there are ways to fix the problem while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system 
according to hussein ibish an expert on the persian gulf littoral states jasta will cause chaos at the international level 
last september european union warned other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity this threat was an addition written letters to us government 
also france the netherlands and the united kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law the gulf littoral states turkey iraq jordan pakistan and japan protested against jasta 
the saudius relations in danger of jasta 
bernard haykel princeton university professor said if saudi king does not appear in new york court to be interrogated warrant will be issued against saudi arabia riyadh and washington relations declined over the past three years especially with obamas policies on syria jasta shows saudi ruling that obama turned his back to its allies in the middle east he added 
riyadh strictly denies his involvement in  while  of the  were from saudi arabia turki alfaisal the former head of saudi intelligence also comments america wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past  years 
jasta law does not refer to saudi arabia it would allow families of the victims of the september  terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack",0

"sometimes the road to diet change can be fun ad   hbs account   httpblogsnaturalnewscomsometimesroaddietchangecanfun 
by hesh goldstein 
posted friday october   at am edt 
when i was a kid if i were told that id be writing a book about diet and nutrition when i was older i wouldve thought that whoever told me that was out of their mind 
living in newark new jersey my parents and i consumed anything and everything that had a face or a mother except for dead rotting pig bodies although we did eat bacon as if all the other decomposing flesh bodies were somehow miraculously clean going through high school and college it was no different in fact my dietary change did not come until i was in my s 
just to put things in perspective after i graduated from weequahic high school and before going to seton hall university i had a parttime job working for a butcher i was the delivery guy and occasionally had to go to the slaughterhouse to pick up products for the store needless to say i had no consciousness nor awareness as change never came then despite the horrors i witnessed on an almost daily basis 
after graduating with a degree in accounting from seton hall i eventually got married and moved to a town called livingston livingston was basically a yuppie community where everyone was judged by the neighborhood they lived in and their income to say it was a plastic community would be an understatement 
livingston and the shallowness finally got to me i told my wife i was fed up and wanted to move she made it clear she had to be near her friends and new york city i finally got my act together and split for colorado 
i was living with a lady in aspen at the end of  when one day she said  lets become vegetarians i have no idea what possessed me to say it but i said okay 
at that point i went to the freezer and took out about  worth of frozen dead body parts and gave them to a welfare mother who lived behind us 
well everything was great for about a week or so and then the chick split with another guy 
so here i was a vegetarian for a couple weeks not really knowing what to do how to cook or basically how to prepare anything for about a month i was getting by on carrot sticks celery sticks and yogurt fortunately when i went vegan in  it was a simple and natural progression anyway as i walked around aspen town i noticed a little vegetarian restaurant called the little kitchen 
let me back up just a little bit it was april of  the snow was melting and the runoff of ajax mountain filled the streets full of kneedeep mud now aspen was great to ski in but was a bummer to walk in when the snow was melting 
i was ready to call it quits and i needed a warmer place ill elaborate on that in a minute 
but right now back to the little kitchen knowing that i was going to leave aspen and basically a new vegetarian i needed help so i cruised into the restaurant and told them my plight and asked them if they would teach me how to cook i told them in return i would wash dishes and empty their trash they then asked me what i did for a living and i told them i was an accountant 
the owner said to me lets make a deal you do our tax return and well feed you as well so for the next couple of weeks i was doing their tax return washing their dishes emptying the trash eating three squares a day and learning as much as i could 
but like i said the mud was getting to me so i picked up a travel book written by a guy named foder the name of the book was hawaii looking through the book i noticed that in lahaina on maui there was a little vegetarian restaurant called mr naturals i decided right then and there that i would go to lahaina and work at mr naturals to make a long story short thats exactly what happened 
so im working at mr naturals and learning everything i can about my new dietary lifestyle  it was great every afternoon we would close for lunch at about  pm and go to the sheraton hotel in kaanapali and play volleyball while somebody stayed behind to prepare dinner 
since i was the new guy and didnt really know how to cook i never thought that i would be asked to stay behind to cook dinner well one afternoon thats exactly what happened it was my turn that posed a problem for me because i was at the point where i finally knew how to boil water 
i was desperate clueless and basically up the creek without a paddle fortunately there was a friend of mine sitting in the gazebo at the restaurant and i asked him if he knew how to cook he said the only thing he knew how to cook was enchiladas he said that his enchiladas were beanless and dairyless i told him that i had no idea what an enchilada was or what he was talking about but i needed him to show me because it was my turn to do the evening meal 
well the guys came back from playing volleyball and im asked what was for dinner i told them enchiladas the owner wasnt thrilled i told him that mine were beanless and dairyless when he tried the enchilada he said it was incredible being the humble guy that i was i smiled and said you expected anything less it apparently was so good that it was the only item on the menu that we served twice a week in fact after about a week we were selling five dozen every night we had them on the menu and people would walk around lahaina broadcasting enchiladas at naturals tonight i never had to cook anything else 
a year later the restaurant closed and somehow i gravitated to a little health food store in wailuku i never told anyone i was an accountant and basically relegated myself to being the truck driver 
the guys who were running the health food store had friends in similar businesses and farms on many of the islands i told them that if they could organize and form one company they could probably lock in the state thats when they found out i was an accountant and down to earth was born down to earth became the largest natural food store chain in the islands and i was their chief financial officer and comanager of their biggest store for  years 
in  i started to do a weekly radio show to try and expose people to a vegetarian diet and get them away from killing innocent creatures i still do that show today i pay for my own airtime and have no sponsors to not compromise my honesty one bit of a hassle was the fact that i was forced to get a masters degree in nutrition to shut up all the mds that would call in asking for my credentials 
my doing this radio show enabled me through endless research to see the corruption that existed within the big food industries the big pharmaceutical companies the biotech industries and the government agencies 
this information unconscionable as it is enabled me to realize how broken our health system is 
i left down to earth in  got nationally certified as a sports injury massage therapist and started traveling the world with a bunch of guys that were making a martial arts movie after doing that for about four years i finally made it back to honolulu and got a job as a massage therapist at the honolulu club one of hawaiis premier fitness clubs 
it was there i met the love of my life who i have been with since  she made me an offer i couldnt refuse she said if you want to be with me youve got to stop working on naked women so i went back into accounting and was the chief financial officer of a large construction company for many years 
going back to my newark days when i was an infant i had no idea what a chicken or egg or fish or pig or cow was my dietary blueprint was thrust upon me by my parents as theirs was thrust upon them by their parents it was by the grace of god that i was able to put things in their proper perspective and improve my health and elevate my consciousness 
the road that i started walking down in  has finally led me to the point of writing my book a sane diet for an insane world hopefully the information contained therein will be enlightening motivating and inspiring to encourage you to make different choices 
doing what we do out of conditioning is not always the best course to follow i am hoping that by the grace of the many friends and personalities i have encountered along my path you will have a better perspective of what road is the best road for you to travel on not only for your health but your consciousness as well

"judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary unelected and unaccountable  rule on their empathetic feelings published  mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print 
a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said 
see jonathans cahns message at washington man of prayer event at the capitol 
the united states conference of catholic bishops is calling samesex marriage an intrinsic evil 
and officials from several counties in tennessee have adopted statements opposing the supreme court 
wnd also reported when dozens of top legal scholars from the likes of washington  lee boston college kansas state notre dame university of texas villanova vanderbilt hillsdale university of nebraska catholic university and regent university issued a statement encouraging all state and federal officials to treat the supreme courts recent creation of samesex marriage as anticonstitutional and illegitimate 
it cannot  be taken to have settled the law of the united states said the statement from the american principles project  
we call on all federal and state officeholders to refuse to accept obergefell as binding precedent for all but the specific plaintiffs in that case to recognize the authority of states to define marriage and the right of federal and state officeholders to act in accordance with those definitions to pledge full and mutual legal and political assistance to anyone who refuses to follow obergefell for constitutionally protected reasons to open forthwith a broad and honest conversation on the means by which americans may constitutionally resist and overturn the judicial usurpations evidence in obergefell",1
"this is the best picture in human history by november   
this is the best picture in human history 
it is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties the republic and why we are where we are 
on the left side of this picture we have donald trump  a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian the new presidentelect of the united states he points his fingers and smiles that apprentice smile as he makes a point 
on the right side of this picture we have barack obama  a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant he sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office and obama rightly looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes 
behind obama sits a bust of abraham lincoln his eyes downcast mourning for his country 
yep 
greatest picture ever 
this is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant barack obamas image of himself is not accurate  to americans obama is a reality tv show star he transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfiestick celebrityridden sinkhole of hollywood glitterati hobnobbing with glozell and macklemore cracking wise about the presidency with jimmy kimmel before saying that a reality star like trump could never be president 
this picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost as obamas former pastor might put it 
and then theres lincoln 
lincoln who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration mourning behind barack obama who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain 
lincoln who represented wisdom mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd given republicans domination of the senate and the congress i have hopes for trumps presidency  i hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises  but trump occupying lincolns office is at best a jarring visual 
thats the picture",1
"email 
donald trump is again riling up his voting base with claims that the november election will be rigged against him 
of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day trump tweeted monday morning why do republican leaders deny what is going on so naive 
its a charge that even other republicans have been quick to refute critics have called such talk potentially dangerous and detrimental to trust in the us democratic process 
states backed by tens of thousands of gop and dem volunteers ensure integrity of electoral process sen jeff flake of arizona who is often sharply critical of trump tweeted sunday elections are not rigged 
jon husted the secretary of state of ohio and the top election official in the key battleground state also said monday that he could assure trump the election would not be rigged 
trumps most recent claims coincided with a plunge by him in the polls before now trump most recently made similar claims when his polls numbers were taking a dive in early august 
and im telling you november  wed better be careful because that election is going to be rigged the new york billionaire told fox news host sean hannity in august and i hope the republicans are watching closely or its going to be taken away from us 
multiple republicans told business insider at the time that trumps assertion was both ludicrous and dangerous as trump would be the first us presidential candidate in modern times possibly ever to blame an election loss on voter fraud or a rigged election 
allen raymond a former gop operative who was involved in the  new hampshire senate election phonejamming scandal called trumps continued insistence that the election would be rigged detrimental to the republic 
the idea that its rigged i dont know what hes talking about he said in august i know someone that rigged elections i mean you know the fact of the matter is hillary clinton doesnt need to rig this election trumps going to win alabama and thats it she doesnt have to do anything its painful to watch 
raymond wrote how to rig an election confessions of a republican operative as a tellall about the attempt to rig the  new hampshire senate election between thengov jeanne shaheen a democrat and republican us rep john e sununu raymond said that attempted rigging was centered on jamming the phone lines at the new hampshire democrats office in manchester  a task his phone bank was hired to carry out sununu went on to win the election by roughly  votes shaheen defeated sununu in a rematch in  
the operative served a brief prison sentence for his involvementhe said any attempts to rig an election would look similar to that  not what trumps talking about 
the manhattan billionaire told the washington post in august that a lack of voteridentification laws would let people just keep voting and voting and voting and suggested fraud occurred in  against republican nominee mitt romney because there were precincts where there were practically nobody voting for the republican 
i dont even know what hes talking about raymond said but this idea that its  or  and the party bosses are going to roll into pittsburgh and philadelphia and are going to rig the ballot box and rig the machines  thats nonsense an election rigging these days means something totally different than what hes talking about now its stupid stuff like what i did in new hampshire 
he said the lack of voterid laws trump was trying to use as proof of fraud this fall was also bogus 
these voterid laws whats the intention of that the clear intention is disenfranchisement he said echoing a common complaint in liberal circles that voterid laws are put in place to prevent minority voting blocks from being able to cast ballots you know theres a reason we dont have a poll tax anymore because its unconstitutional 
people dont vote  times he continued there might be one bad actor every once in a while who tries to vote a couple of times but hes talking about an institutional effort its a total myth 
he said trumps statements were an attempt to basically sideline hillary clintons first four years in office 
the idea of a rigged election came to the forefront after the democratic national committee had its emails hacked and leaked though both trump and sen bernie sanders of vermont clintons main opponent in the democratic primary had claimed the electoral system was rigged earlier in the primary season the emails showed that the organization which was supposed to remain neutral throughout the primary favored clinton 
trump said the email leak proved that the primary election was rigged against sanders in his earlyaugust interview with hannity in addition to such claims he perpetuated along the campaign trail he used the leak as further evidence that the fall election would be rigged against him as well",0
"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election michael on television we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash   november th  
since donald trumps victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in  years  global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since november th and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a trump administration will mean much higher inflation and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of us history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect sense because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later 
for those that are not familiar with the bond market when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go down that is bad news for economic growth 
so we generally dont want yields to go up 
unfortunately yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks and the yield on  year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since july  
the year treasury yield jumped to  in late trading on friday the highest since december  up  basis point since the election and up one full percentage point since july 
the year yield is at a critical juncture in terms of reality the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in december after a year of flipflopping a slew of postelection pronouncements by fed heads  including yellens relatively soon  have pushed the odds of a rate hike to  
as i noted the other day  so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on us treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as wolf richter has noted  the average rate on  year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere 
the carnage in bonds has consequences the average interest rate of the a conforming year fixed mortgage as of friday was quoted at  for top credit scores thats up about  percentage point from just before the election according to mortgage news daily  it put the month on a short list of  worst months in more than a decade 
if mortgage rates continue to shoot higher there will be another housing crash 
rates on auto loans credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down 
why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from steve bannon  
in a nascent administration that seems at best random in its beliefs bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice but almost a messianic one 
like andrew jacksons populism were going to build an entirely new political movement he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship yards iron works get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the s greater than the reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movement 
steve bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new trump administration and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress 
and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add  trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year 
sadly all of this comes at a time when the us economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in yearoveryear earnings for the sp  and industrial production has now contracted for  months in a row  
the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now and it isnt going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance roberts  
with an economy running at below  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak for the bulk of americans there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes 
combine weak economics with higher interest rates which negatively impacts consumption and a stronger dollar which weighs on exports and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later 
yes the stock market soared immediately following trumps election but it wasnt because economic conditions actually improved 
if you look at history a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders 
and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the trump administration it is inevitable that stock prices will follow 
the waning days of the obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash 
of course any problems that occur after january th  will be blamed on trump but the truth is that obama will be far more responsible for what happens than trump will be 
right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because donald trump won the election 
that is an enormous mistake 
a shaking has already begun in the financial world and this shaking could easily become an avalanche 
now is not a time to party rather it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead 
all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly but without a doubt they are still on the way 
so get prepared while you still can because time is running out",1

and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience

"the following post was sponsored by chad cocker and written by matt forney 
everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth thats how i felt when i was tasked with writing a review of chad t cockers memoirs of a misogynist an erotic novel for men  what kind of man would want to read an erotic novel romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians
or so i thought
despite the packaging memoirs of a misogynist is one of the best works ive read this year contrary to cockers marketing the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern america filtered through the protagonists relationships with women while it starts slowly cockers prose and honesty save the day and make memoirs of a misogynist absolutely worth your time and money
from the marquis de sade to neomasculinity 
because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature from braggadocios fratire writers like tucker max and maddox to loser lit authors such as andy nowicki and ann sterzinger to our very own roosh and quintus curtius theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world
viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing memoirs of a misogynist is an odd animal indeed when i first picked it up i assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of rooshs a dead bat in paraguay or a roman à clef in the fashion of charles bukowskis work however it does indeed live up to its subtitle as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encounters
shed also gotten used to her chastity belt and that scared her it still didnt sit well with her that master had total control over her sexual gratification slave was constantly wet and horny and that made her even more compliant the orgasms that master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before they were mindblowing even after a year together their sex was electric and deeply satisfying
in the introduction cocker warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest most depraved and most offensive novel youve ever read making me wonder if hes ever heard of  days of sodom still the structure of memoirs plot and the skill of cockers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls the first half of the book is reminiscent of pauline reages story of o in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave
interestingly memoirs of a misogynist also seems inspired by venus in furs not the velvet underground song but the erotic novel by leopold von sachermasoch its from sachermasoch that we derive the term masochism the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from sade as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way that cockers protagonist is one
that woman as nature has created her and man at present is educating her is mans enemy she can only be his slave or his despot but never his companion this she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work
its worth noting that sachermasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation insert your own joke here
power doesnt care what you need as long as youre on your knees 
enjoying memoirs of a misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters which read like fifty shades of grey with about  extra iq points the initial plot concerns melinda a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book after offering her room and board the man and melinda begin a relationship sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything
my body is my masters it is his blank canvas for him to modify as many times and in as many different ways as he chooses he could hear her breath quickening as he read he will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms i will only orgasm when my master allows me 
what saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as master far from the masturbatory blank slate that christian grey was cocker depicts master as a complex and conflicted character constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats melinda later rechristened slave cockers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end the book also frequently switches to melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well
where memoirs really picks up is in the second half which is set nearly ten years later the focus shifts to elizabeth avery a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient destitute and despondent she accepts a job as the personal physician of masters stable of whores his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities
doctor averys world was spinning she tried to distance herself this was just a patient after all she was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems regardless she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way hed said she consented to this in fact the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation the woman or melinda as the man had called her looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration
once again it would have been easy for cocker to depict elizabeth as a raging braburning feminist stereotype but he agilely avoids clichés in favor of nuance elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it the final chapters of the book show elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for mr x her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up i wont spoil the ending other than to say that after finishing the book i had to sit on it and digest it for a few days
each chapter of memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in america today a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action i initially wondered why they were there but as i approached the end of the book it all suddenly clicked memoirs of a misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women american dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead there are no winners no saints and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system
as i stated earlier memoirs takes a while to really get going and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex the book wont appeal to you but if you want a haunting piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations memoirs of a misogynist is a mustbuy i cant wait to see what cocker comes up with next

presidential debates between donald trump and hillary clinton included a third participant vladimir putin standing in the background stealthily inserting himself in the process putins russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism to actively prank the american political system and its taking a toll   this is the putin playbook steal cheat attack disrupt mislead confuse if caught lie and deny and it gets worse 
unfortunately the republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent his outbursts follow years of domestic political discord where comity is history crazy seems the new normal and a sitting president can be heckled with you lie 
all told the piece reads like a clinton press release but its actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse in the october  sacramento bee  two days after the comey email bombshell the author is markos kounalakis billed as a senior fellow at central european university and visiting fellow at the hoover institution that doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the clintons which have shown up in wikileaks 
mr kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter of realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according to greek usa reporter  angelo is a top political donor to the clintons as well as the democratic party whose donations to former president bill clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious lincoln bedroom in  tsakopoulos confirmed that hillary clinton will seek the democratic nomination in the next presidential election 
angelos daughter eleni a protégé of nancy pelosi and barbara boxer  raised more than  million for hillary clinton in   and that money found its reward on january   us secretary of state hillary clinton swore in tsakopouloskounalakis as us ambassador to hungary in that capacity  she condemned wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables but declined comment on the authenticity of the material tsakopouloskounalakis served as ambassador until  but as wikileaks confirms she continued as a key clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by joe biden 
in a june   email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta that a bay area bagman swears biden is running he said he took him on air force two and hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan that hrc indicated her view that it would be best to avoid grexit and a july   email to sullivan john podesta and huma abedin she supports terms that will allow greece to stay in the eurozone 
on october   tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta that there is a greek american love fest going on with joe biden very boyclub the same day she emailed podesta and huma abedin that we had a david brock dinner with annie karni from politico she asked to use four quotes from me see attached i told her the first two could be with attribution and the second two without 
as the emails to john podesta and humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis as she styles herself remains part of hillary clintons inner circle tellingly the mcclatchytribune newspapers that run her husbands columns do not acknowledge the strong clinton connection 
the new york times proclaimed kounalakis a white knight for rescuing washington monthly  where he served as publisher and teamed with editor paul glastris this tandem made the publication a progressive mustread according to clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported for newsweek in east germany and ran their bureau in prague he also worked in moscow for nbc radio and mutual news 
kounalakis books include hope is a tattered flag voices for the postbush era  with peter laufer and beyond spin the power of strategic corporate journalism with drew banks and kim daus it remains something of a mystery how the leftist kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the hoover institution known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as thomas sowell victor davis hanson and bruce thornton 
only one time as this writer recalls has kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong clinton connections even after the wikileaks revelations and with a presidential election only days away kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles 
kounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy 
the author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones",1

"i am a rock n roll nigger httpsyoutubegsovftvlrk daniel w mccullar 
as a mix blood american any time i hear someone in the black community use the n word in any way or form i hear and see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay 
thanks for the comment my nigga guy 
although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  
you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  
we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  
we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr 
she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy 
so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original archie bunker and gladys shows and thought they were great i never liked gov wallace and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed mr king was right while thinking that sharpton and jackson are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of hillary who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr 
im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr 
further more fuck jessie jackson im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy 
mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  
now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  
what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  
personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  
i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children 
i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  
when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  
if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr 
you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy 
no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area 
brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  
my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding 
now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  
my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  
as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr 
get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy 
i am a little confused which is not hard to do 
i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  
if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  
for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  
i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it 
but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  
i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in 
cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr 
yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy 
damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  
it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene 
i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing 
unfortunately that is the times we all live in and certainly it is unfair to you to be victimised because of it i hope you filed a complant against this ass hole to seek retrabutin  mr 
i understand that ive did things in my life im not happy bout cant sleep at nite the nightmare i have i jus take it one day at a time and think god im still breathing truth be told i almost lost my life  times before i was  and the only thing slowed me down from the streets is my first son hes  now my middle son  and my baby boy is  and i have a lil girl that jus turned  so i thank god a lot cause i have something to live for havent been to a club in yrs it feels good to be out the streets and doing some good for a change only thing i have did to make my life complete is going back to church but ill go when im ready but i do read the bible so there for i dont forget where i come from i respect u and dont know u its actually good we had this chat everything u told me i took that inconsideration truly i thank u i dont know everything but i dont mind listen mr 
i stop dealing drugs a few yrs ago actually until i find a job that pays  a hr when my ma first found out she had cancer i use to make sure i would not go home unless i had  a week in my pocket to help my ma with her medical bills and medicine she fought that cancer for yrs right before she died  yrs ago i promise her i wouldnt sale anymore and that was a promise i keep  at the end of the month i had to put in a lot of blood and tears for what i did and my ma was not proud of the blood money i was bringing into the home but when she seen what i was actually doing with my money i think she respect me to a certain degree and i accepted that sometimes she would accept nothing from me ive been locked up  times and started dealing weedcokegunspills at the age of  honestly my ma use to beat me when she found out but i never stopped i caught my first charge at  by the time i was  i had did everything i could possibly do i think i had a good run in life i never had my father after the fact he was a big time drug dealer and him and ma got a divorce and he got on his on product and lost everything he been sober for  yrs he doing good but i never hated him for what he did in life actually it made me stronger i had a step dad but only he was good for is taking me fishing far talking to bout men things he did cause he didnt know how to cause he had  girls but at the end of the day he raised me from the time i was  until he passed he was good man in his own ways and till this day i thank god for each parent i had in my life with no regrets i jus wish the world become a better place guy 
hey  at least you are still alive and hopefully clean and sober with a family that loves you  that is a lot more than some of the people you knew when you were running the streets ill bet consider yourself mr to be blessed  
never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  
i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  
what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do 
hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr 
im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy 
good to hear now what are you doing  mr 
doing father dutys guy 
so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts 
just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy 
i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr 
as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy 
of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural 
my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way 
there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years 
you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  
mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr 
i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton 
call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do 
in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy 
i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton 
on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online 
we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online 
however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy 
she and everyone else who speaks in public  
trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton  
thanks for taking the time to further explain your point and now that you have i tend to agree with you although i still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady was harsh  
but considering she works in a public tax supported office its to be expected to bad she dint have the common sense to see it  hill billy",1
"more people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens is the way forward a problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power
imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink instead of nagging at him every evening which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again the husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out
right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members in other words globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap a device they transform into to their advantage as of right now the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right
elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
the way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic  meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other create friction and from that comes a desired result ie order from chaos those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends
the recent rise in nationalism i speculate has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda soviet communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in syria and iran to proceed like  did with iraq and afghanistan in addition the white vs black race war is years late stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that obama pours onto the fire a new dialectic must be nurtured and so nationalism may just do the trick hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism as the new enemy
while your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true and im sure to agree with it you were guided onto those beliefs how did you arrive at nationalist thought through decades of free trade feminism and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of george soros who pulled out a million muslims from his hat and placed them in europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the united states his actions and behavior along with other powerful globalists like him have essentially created your very ideology because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other
the growth of nationalism is useful nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests and when it does the globalists will clamp down severely on it as if replaying world war  they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking and even poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets

a hint that this may already be taking place is that france recently called upon patriots to serve in their national guard to protect citizens since when does france care about patriots they have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death i wouldnt be surprised if frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like poland which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly western europeans
as long as youre in the dialectic which i see as a sort of twilight zone creation of the mega rich youre fighting on their terms they need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate good and evil as if we were living in a hollywoodstyle storyline instead of this twodimensional arrangement the solution may be to go d where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick
just because a nationalist resistance is growing doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt without being able to effectively control the western population through the cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer or modern russian aggression they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward while im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs as i surely wont throw away mine it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung and we will all suffer when its finally launched

"keywords better tasting food  gmos  homestead  homesteading 
if you clicked a link that got you to this page you cant pretend that you are not interested in homesteading any longer im not sure if you are afraid of the effort afraid that you wont know what to do or what you are afraid of but its time to get up and get going 
i have been homesteading for over  years and wouldnt change it for anything in the world my husband and i have made many mistakes along the way but we have never been afraid to put in the hard work to get any job done for all our hard work we have become one of the rare profitable homesteads that are more than just surviving 
we all have our own reasons that we want to try homesteading so dont base yours off of mine i am just hoping to spark some interest to get you off your feet so you can make your dream become a reality i provide healthy food for my family 
we are not vegan vegetarian of allergic to gluten but we are completely aware of what we are putting into our bodies i just dont like to buy vegetables from the grocery store that have been produced chemically i also dont like to buy meat that was fed all sorts of things that i dont know about 
everything that i put on my kitchen table to feed my family has been grown or produced by me or someone i know i know that the corn we ate last night was grown using some organic soil water and a little alpaca poop for good measure the pork also came from our farm and i know about everything that pig ate in his very happy two years of life 
im not saying that we are the healthiest family in the world but i know we arent eating chemicals  that is what matters to me and my husband the food tastes so much better 
the food that we produce on our homestead is so much better that the food you are purchasing at the grocery store the truth is that they are looking to produce as much perfect looking food as they can as fast as they can they dont want to grow the strands of produce that take a little longer but taste exponentially better 
the meat also takes better because you arent rushing that either not to mention the fact that you are feeding the animals with healthier and better tasting food when you slaughter the food yourself it will taste better as well animals that are stressed when they get slaughtered produce meat that is much tougher that meat that we produce here on the homestead freedom 
not many people can say that they have complete freedom to do what they please during the day now that doesnt mean that we dont have responsibilities but we can take an hour off in the middle of the day to attend the elementary school winter concert we can also take those doctor appointments in the middle of the day when the office isnt insane 
if you want to get freedom over your own life start homesteading today  we have economic security 
if the economy crashes we are not in risk of going without anything that we really need we dont rely on anyone for any of the basic necessities including a source of income we have everything that we need in order to survive right here on the homestead there isnt much that can go wrong with the government that could put us at risk 
i am not an apocalypse prepper but i will say that homesteaders are more prepared should a disaster occur we have more knowledge and experience in all of the tasks needed in an extreme survival situation than most people i know our kids understand the meaning of hard work 
im not saying that your kids dont understand the meaning of hard work but my kids have been there and done that my nine year old wakes up two hours before school and takes care of the chickens every day those chickens are completely her responsibility and she know that 
i do allow my kids to use electronics during down time they just know the difference between down time and chore time they feel like they are part of the team so it doesnt feel like we are making them do chores every day you might also like",0

according to the jasta law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks it is so likely that saudi king be tried according to experts the passing of jasta may cause international chaos especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute us officials if us do so 
is it possible that saudi king salman bin abdul aziz being tried for potential liability in events of september  the trial is possible by the legislation of jasta by jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations 
in late september united states congress ignored president obamas advice and his veto and passed jasta law the justice against sponsors of terrorism act this law made ussaudi relation more chaotic 
us confederate states expressed concern to jasta legislation 
not just saudi arabia expressed concerns to jasta us confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the us quasisacred treaty with saudi arabia and asked for appealing france and the netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against usa and its military and diplomacy allies 
john kerry united states secretary of state showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk a few days ago kerry and adel aljubeir discussed about the ramifications of jasta and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of us interests he said there are ways to fix the problem while experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of america in complaining by circumvent the law 
even saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system 
according to hussein ibish an expert on the persian gulf littoral states jasta will cause chaos at the international level 
last september european union warned other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity this threat was an addition written letters to us government 
also france the netherlands and the united kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law the gulf littoral states turkey iraq jordan pakistan and japan protested against jasta 
the saudius relations in danger of jasta 
bernard haykel princeton university professor said if saudi king does not appear in new york court to be interrogated warrant will be issued against saudi arabia riyadh and washington relations declined over the past three years especially with obamas policies on syria jasta shows saudi ruling that obama turned his back to its allies in the middle east he added 
riyadh strictly denies his involvement in  while  of the  were from saudi arabia turki alfaisal the former head of saudi intelligence also comments america wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past  years 
jasta law does not refer to saudi arabia it would allow families of the victims of the september  terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack",0
"obamas secret muslim list why enemies of israel and irans goto guy appeared on the list november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments 
it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood 
it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them 
obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american 
when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror 
we dont have religious tests he insisted 
except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war 
syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence 
but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test 
of course he would 
the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees 
the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian 
how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama 
most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta 
religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians 
thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations 
this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies 
administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates 
obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders 
the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood 
he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list 
also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state 
the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions 
obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for 
the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout 
eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair 
dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc 
also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure 
the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims 
this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american",1
"home this month popular  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women david g brown 
david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls 
forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses 
of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man 
so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them 
i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested 
in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants 
this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working 
remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed 
at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped 
in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships 
unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals 
in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less 
when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself 
unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established 
on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot 
your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker 
this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl 
perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them 
snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution 
so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation",0

"the email that got john podesta hacked latest wikileaks dump reveals phishing email that compromised podesta mikael thalen  october   comments 
the email that lead to the hack of clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account was published online friday by wikileaks 
the malicious march  email which claims to be from google asked podesta to change his password due to unauthorized access from an ip address in the ukraine 
clinton campaign staff members who viewed the email were convinced it was genuine clinton insider sara latham argued the gmail one is real while even clinton campaign it specialist charles delavan said this is a legitimate email 
the first suspicious aspect of the email unnoticed by the clinton camp was the bitly password reset link bitly a website that shortens long web addresses would not be found in an official email from google 
as first reported by motherboard earlier this month examination of the bitly link that redirected podesta to a fake google webpage also contained several red flags 
the bitly link helped hide not only the fact that the landing page ended in tk instead of com but that the web page itself failed to use https encryption such links were also likely used to fool googles spam filters 
prior analysis of the phishing link by cybersecurity group secureworks revealed the hackers also made a significant operation security mistake  they failed to make their two bitly accounts private 
the public accounts revealed the hackers had created  similar links to use against  gmail accounts between october  and may  
secureworks notes that the targets included individuals in russia and the former soviet states current and former military and government personnel in the us and europe individuals working in the defense and government supply chain and authors and journalists 
accounts linked to the  election were also in the hackers sights 
specific targets include staff working for or associated with hillary clintons presidential campaign and the democratic national committee dnc including individuals managing clintons communications travel campaign finances and advising her on policy 
thomas rid a professor at kings college displayed on twitter how decoding the phishing links could reveal the specific emails being targeted 
click to enlarge interestingly former secretary of state colin powell whose emails were released by the website dcleaks in september was also targeted by the same hackers 
click to enlarge this connection suggests the hackers who provided wikileaks with the podesta emails and dcleaks with the powell emails are likely one in the same the bitly accounts are also behind the malicious email sent to retired fourstar general philip mark breedlove  whose emails appeared on dcleaks in april 
numerous cybersecurity groups have accused the russian government of being responsible not only for the above election season hacks but for creating dcleaks and guccifer  to disseminate the data the us government also publicly blamed russia on october  just one week before the cia was tasked with preparing a possible retaliatory  cyber strike  
russian president vladimir putin has denied involvement arguing that the contents of the hacks are far more important than who is responsible

ramallah occupied west bank  enas taha a resident of the palestinian village of kafr aldeek in the occupied west bank has become desperate 
since the water crisis started in june the municipality has been able to supply water for only one hour twice a week taha told al jazeera i am checking the weather forecast every day they announced rain three weeks ago but it has not come yet the only thing i can do is to pray to god 
many west bank communities are facing similar problems amid an acute water shortage that has lasted for months in the salfit jenin and hebron governorates some villages have gone as long as  days in a row without running water 
in midjuly residents in the bethlehem area staged a sitin for days to protest against the shortages sparking clashes between palestinian youths and israeli forces 
it is a very stressful situation i have to consider and prioritise every single drop of water i use taha said we have barely enough to drink cook shower and use the bathroom sometimes i dont do the laundry or clean the house for weeks it is hot and dusty this is exhausting enas taha shows her garden which has turned brown due to the severe water shortages since june eloise bollackal jazeera 
some palestinians have joked that the water bill collector comes to their homes more often than water as demand rises the cost of drinking water has skyrocketed with some families spending up to  percent of their meagre incomes to purchase it 
israel implements a policy of water cuts each summer but this year it reached an unprecedented peak in early june israeli water company mekorot informed the palestinian water authority pwa of summertime supply cuts totalling more than  percent  and the cuts while not as dramatic remain in effect today more than a month after the official end of summer 
we are in regular contact with mekorot to find a solution but they constantly give us different excuses such as the increase in demand rising temperature etc deeb abdelghafour the pwas director of the water resources department told al jazeera 
the notion that the region is suffering from water scarcity is a myth he added 
we have been facing shortages for decades and the reason is not natural but manmade  meaning the israeli occupation and israeli control over water resources in the palestinian territories 
israeli officials have stated that water resources are shared equally in israel and the occupied palestinian territories israels coordinator of government activities in the territories a unit in the israeli army noted that israel provides  million cubic metres of water to the palestinians annually even though it is only obliged to provide  million under the oslo accords 
however disparity is evident in the lush gardens parks and swimming pools in illegal israeli settlements the key difference is that palestinian villages in the west bank are not connected to the national water grid relying instead on local underground supplies 
palestinians living in remote areas have been hit the hardest by the ongoing water crisis as access roads are often poor and the additional costs of delivery result in higher prices 
we need special  trucks to drive on the unpaved roads and it can take up to two hours to reach the communities said hafez hureini a resident of attuwani village and leader of the south hebron hills popular committee taha shows her empty beehives last year we had bees so we could produce our own honey but all the bees died due to lack of water there are not enough flowers eloise bollackal jazeera 
over the summer israeli media reported that illegal jewish settlements in the west bank were also suffering from daily disruptions to water supplies prompting the israeli government to establish a new drilling site ariel  which would provide  cubic metres of water per hour 
abdelrahman tamimi director of the palestinian hydrology group for water and environmental resources development said that this was not where water was needed the most 
the wells should be drilled where there is important demand such as north and south of jenin south of hebron or northwest of the jordan valley why in ariel i wonder as a hydrologist there is already a well there they can simply improve its capacity  this measure was definitely not designed to supply palestinian communities tamimi told al jazeera 
in the meantime israel has accused palestinians of tapping into pipes with the israeli water authority asserting that  cubic metres of water is stolen every day by palestinians 
we are aware there is water theft  however we should ask ourselves why are the people stealing water simply because they are thirsty abdelghafour said 
at the same time increased water demands owing to growing israeli and palestinian populations is stretching the limits of existing water infrastructure most of the water network was installed in  when israel occupied the west bank today the diameters of the pipes are inadequate and the system is reaching the end of its life cycle 
even to upgrade infrastructure in area a and b is a headache abdelghafour said they israel impose long and complicated procedures in order to issue permits to import the smallest pieces or equipment 
data released by the israeli water authority shows that a large expansion in agriculture in the settlements has led to an estimated rise of  to  percent in water consumption this year 
the palestinian authority has no solution for the water crisis in my opinion israel has used this summer to put more pressure on us to purchase desalinated water so they can allocate groundwater for the settlements and their future expansion tamimi said 
since  five desalination plants have been built in israel now producing approximately  percent of the countrys water supply 
we dont want to substitute water from desalination plants for our historical rights to all shared water resources abdelghafour said once we have our basic rights based on equitable allocation of resources and international law then we can think of other development options such as desalination or treatment of waste water the original source of this article is al jazeera",0
"by robert franek on sun oct th  at  am imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing share on twitter print this post 
the following post written by the rev robert a franek is a part of politicus policy discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy 
even after months and months of coverage blown out of proportion and at great expense to the public in dollars psychic stress and issue coverage it seems all one has to do is put hillary clinton and emails together in the same sentence with claims of lying and threatening national security and pandemonium continues to break loose throughout the mass media and social media worlds and yet despite multiple investigations and repeated explanations the pandemonium persists so much so that every time republicans stir up some smoke the media assumes there must be a blazing fire and sadly this is not going away anytime soon as republicans are promising more sham investigations in lieu of actually governing as sarah jones reported 
republicans are already planning how to avoid being grown ups who do their jobs if hillary clinton is elected president yes there will be more toythrowing and tantrums and best of all for the party of fiscal humiliations more wasteful spending on political witch hunts  sarah jones 
meanwhile women continue to come forward with painful heartbreaking stories of donald trumps sexual harassment and assault yet instead of being portrayed as survivors who have finally had enough of the republican presidential nominee and his lies and as women who have the strength and courage to go public with their stories they are being made into opportunistic victims and challenged for not coming forward sooner much sooner woefully no mention is made of the many intersecting reasons that lead many women and men not to report these crimes including that this is the only time when the victim is placed on trial 
after walking her readers through one incident of donald trumps public sexual humiliation of a woman for revenge  sarah jones makes the following observation 
if there is any good to come out of the total crapfest of the trump candidacy perhaps it is a raised awareness that women are people and that this kind of thing is horrific but its not all trumps fault its the cultures fault because it takes a willing audience to successfully publicly sexually shame a woman 
she is right donald trump is despicable still there is cultural culpability in the perpetuation of rape culture where women are treated as objects forced into silence and placed on trial for their assailants crimes 
this must change 
it is unacceptable in a country that places such a high value on freedom that so many are not free from sexual harassment assault exploitation and humiliation more it is appalling that such behavior is often cheered unchallenged and dismissed it is also inexcusable that survivors face unparalleled levels of scrutiny when they do finally come forward 
it is also beyond tragic that people of faith who read the first chapter of genesis cant bear out the implications of men and women being created simultaneously and bearing equally the divine image 
supposed christian values champion and republican vice presidential nominee mike pence is more upset over an article he didnt read regarding voter suppression efforts by the trump campaign than any of the horrifying things donald trump has said including bragging about sexual assault 
these are not christian values nor are they values any civil society should hold failing to call out donald trumps abhorrent behavior and speech is beyond deplorable additionally supporting candidates like donald trump and mike pence gives validity to their wretched views and is especially shocking when done by people of faith and family values 
as a society we must challenge the pervasive and systemic sexism and misogyny that persists in our culture as much as we need changes in our laws and lawmakers at every level of government to reflect the equality and humanity of women we need a moral revival in our collective conscience as a nation that decries every facet of rape culture from how we raise our children to the victim blaming and shaming that happens each time a survivor goes public with their story 
imagine if working to end rape culture were treated with the same attention as hillary clintons emails this is one fire that is burning strong and is a true threat to personal and public safety security and wellbeing

"bellwether trump kippas outselling hillary yarmulkes company sees preference as early exit poll of orthodox jews published  mins ago print 
washington  the campaigns of donald trump and hillary clinton are looking for signs anywhere and everywhere that might suggest who will move into the white house in january 
a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele 
so far the company picakippa has sold  trump yarmulkes to  for clinton 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more uri turk founder and chief kippa officer told wnd we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning once the first debate came around the orders started flying in with much more interest in the trump kippas 
picakippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas the company says on its website 
it donates  percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews who make up over  percent of american jewry vote republican in ever increasing numbers he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel 
a number of influential jewish protrump organizations have emerged chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a  margin 
according to turk picakippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel australia britain and even mexico picakippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs he says",1

"realism about the jihad threat in oklahoma oklahoma state rep john bennett ventures where few dare to tread october   robert spencer 
in an age of nearuniversal denial and willful ignorance at the highest levels about the ideological roots nature and magnitude of the jihad threat it is as unusual as it is refreshing to find lawmakers at any level who are willing to approach the problem honestly state representative john bennett of oklahoma a marine and combat veteran of iraq and afghanistan  is one of an alltoorare breed 
on tuesday bennett held an interim study on the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america in his request to hold this study he explained this will be a study of the current threat posed by radical islam and the effect that shariah law the muslim brotherhood and jihadist indoctrination have in the radicalization process in oklahoma and america 
this kind of study should have been held not just in the oklahoma house of representatives but in the us house and senate as well that such an idea is inconceivable is an indication of the fix were in and the situation is only marginally better in oklahoma nowadays the misinformation and disinformation about what were up against is so universal that anywhere the truth is told about this threat there is significant pushback from the allies and enablers of jihad and islamic supremacism 
and so it was in tulsa on tuesday the interim study featured testimony by former fbi agent john guandolo and chris gaubatz whose exploits as an undercover agent infiltrating the hamaslinked council on americanislamic relations cair are chronicled in the eyeopening book muslim mafia  
gaubatz and guandolo presented evidence including land records showing that the islamic society of greater oklahoma city isgoc is owned by the muslim brotherhood group the north american islamic trust nait that both cair which has an active chapter in oklahoma city and isgoc are muslim brotherhood organizations and that cair has extensive ties to the jihad terror group hamas which styles itself the muslim brotherhood for palestine they pointed out that since imad enchassi the imam of isgoc is a palestinian and has all these ties to the muslim brotherhood he likely also has links to hamas 
guandolo and gaubatz did not base their case on innuendo and hearsay they laid out fbi evidence muslim brotherhood documents and more demonstrating that the claims they were making were based on solid evidence 
predictably however the mainstream media which we now know beyond any shadow of a doubt is simply and solely a propaganda arm for the left and the democratic party  focused entirely on the presence of adam soltani of cairok and enchassi the tulsa world ran a piece with the hysterical headline state representative brands cairok its director and a local imam as terrorists it quoted soltani raging against bennett rep bennett is shamefully wasting taxpayer money to promote his own biased agenda this hearing was a new low for rep bennett as his guests presented a biased narrative that achieves nothing more than demonizing and marginalizing the oklahoma muslim community 
the world magisterially told its readers that cair is a muslim civil liberties and advocacy group working to enhance the understanding of islam it didnt see fit to mention that cair is an unindicted coconspirator in a hamas terror funding case  so named by the justice department there was not a word in the world report about how cair officials have repeatedly refused to denounce hamas and hizballah as terrorist groups several former cair officials have been convicted of various crimes related to jihad terror  cairs cofounder and longtime board chairman omar ahmad as well as its chief spokesman ibrahim hooper have made islamic supremacist statements  ahmad denies this but the original reporter stands by her story  a california chapter distributed a poster telling muslims not to talk to the fbi and a florida chapter distributed pamphlets with the same message  cair has opposed virtually every antiterror measure that has been proposed or implemented and has been declared a terror organization by the united arab emirates 
but the tulsa world and other mainstream media outlets that covered bennetts study did not see fit to inform their readers of any of that instead predictably enough they portrayed the hearing as a baseless exercise in racebaiting and fearmongering conducted by a politician up for reelection 
john bennett and the people of oklahoma deserve better there are legitimate questions about cair and isgoc bennett dared to raise them tuesday for that he is being subjected to a media lynching that is cynically designed to obscure the genuine concerns he raised  yet ever since a member of isgoc beheaded a coworker in  these concerns are more urgent than ever 
the media enablers of jihad must be decisively repudiated please email the speaker of the oklahoma house jeff w hickman politely and courteously expressing your support for john bennett and requesting that his hearing be just the first of a series his email is email protected and his phone number is   
john bennett has yet again stuck his neck out for freedom in these hard times those who are willing to do that have to hang together",1

"britain should embrace unilateral free trade right now unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal louis rouanet  misesorg   image credits iker merodio  flickr  
if we read the newspapers or listen to the experts britain faces two ways to negotiate its way out of the european union without succumbing to the protectionists sirens 
the first is a deal à la norway not only with full access to the common market but also with full implementation of eu law and a contribution to the eu budget as is the case for every member state the second option would be a trade treaty such as the one negotiated between the eu and canada however a viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade 
contrary to what is often assumed unilateralism is not simply a utopian libertarian ideal which cannot be reached in todays world unilateral free trade is genuine freetrade it is also the most pragmatic and efficient strategy to foster commerce and peace theresa may seems ready to conduct an interventionist industrial and economic policy which oddly resembles french planning as it existed in the s and s but the freemarket policy paradigm is more likely to transform postbrexit britain into a flourishing economy 
unilateral free trade the british tradition 
the tradition of unilateral free trade is tightly linked to the uk with the victory of the liberals in the s britain became strongly committed to unilateral free trade and from  to at least  free trade was politically unassailable trade treaties however were seen as inherently suspicious sir robert peel when announcing the repeal of the corn laws in the house of commons in  brilliantly warned 
i trust the government  will not resume the policy which they and we have found most inconvenient namely the haggling with foreign countries about reciprocal concessions instead of taking that independent course which we believe to be conducive to our own interests  let us trust that our example with the proof of practical benefits we derive from it will at no remote period insure the adoption of the principles on which we have acted  let therefore our commerce be as free as our institutions let us proclaim commerce free and nation after nation will follow our example this repeal of the corn laws was the result of an intense political effort especially by cobden and the anticorn law league who made the case for unilateral free trade cobden in his later years explained 
we came to the conclusion that the less we attempted to persuade foreigners to adopt our trade principles the better for we discovered so much suspicion of the motives of england that it was lending an argument to the protectionists abroad to incite the popular feeling against the freetraders  to take away this pretense we avowed our total indifference whether other nations became freetraders or not but we should abolish protection for our own selves and leave other countries to take whatever course they liked best some will argue that the uk soon departed from unilateral free trade with the cobdenchevalier treaty of  which cobden himself supported and negotiated it is less known however that this treaty was primarily a way to avoid conflict after orsinis attempt to murder napoléon iii in  the emperor was convinced by this same orsini to support the cause of italian independence this italian question brought england to the edge of war with france being strongly antimilitarists both cobden and chevalier looked at a trade treaty not primarily as a way to adopt free trade but as a way to establish friendship between france and england gladstone himself an ardent unilateralist in retrospect held that there were only two alternatives one of them the french treaty  the other war with france and cobden felt that the treaty was gods own method to produce an entente cordiale 
commercially the treaty was an incredible success mainly because it was not supervised by bureaucrats  as is the case today with trade treaties  but by two prominent free traders as cobden was aware of all the dangers for real free trade contained in the negotiations of trade treaties he proceeded very carefully cobden wrote in a letter to the great british free trader john bright i will undertake that there is not a syllable on our side of the treaty that is inconsistent with the soundest principles of free trade nonetheless bright remained a skeptic and remarked 
governments seem as a rule to be standing conspiracies to rob and bamboozle people and why should that of louis napoleon be an exception the more i see of the rulers of the world the less of wisdom or greatness do i find necessary for the government of mankind to convince cobden of the benefits brought about by a treaty michel chevalier showed that the unilateral reductions of tariffs that bright asked for could constitute the british side of the bargain and could be extended to all other nations thus avoiding a clear violation of british unilateralism 
free trade with or without you 
the unilateral free trade program is very simple the british parliament declares the abolition of all tariffs to avoid a race in nontariff barriers the parliament can pass a law declaring that every product which conforms to the eu norms and regulations can be sold freely in the uk this should not be a problem since the uk still is a member of the eu by parliaments act most of the nontariff barrier problem withers away without any need for regulatory harmonization if the eu legislator considers it necessary to regulate the curvature of vegetables so be it but although eu producers will be free to sell their product in the uk the british legislator may deem it unnecessary to regulate its producers in the same absurd way 
the advantages of this approach are many first the uk can have free trade now instead of waiting through years of negotiations no need to wait for bureaucrats to agree on which laws we burden consumers and producers with 
the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta for example between the eu and canada contrasts the expediency of unilateralism with endless negotiations negotiations about ceta were started in october  and finished in august  but for the treaty to be effective each eu member state still has to ratify it worse in some european federal member states the treaty must be agreed upon by the local federated states this is why wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening the work of a sixyearlong negotiation in the case of the uk  and whether or not trade treaties are actually advancing free trade  the british economy cannot afford to wait that long for free trade 
the second major advantage of unilateralism is the message you send to brussels you are signifying to the eu apparatus that with or without you we will have free trade at this point the eu will have no leverage left with the uk the negotiation of a trade treaty on the other hand is a hopelessly utopian solution not only because of the obvious coordination problem between the  eu member states but also because the eu has a vested interest in making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting from the contestable assumption that the uk has much more to lose than the eu will try to concoct a deal as bad as possible for their fellow anglosaxon neighbors 
free trade first negotiations later 
still it is possible that after having declared free trade unilaterally the eu will decide to restrict the access of british corporations to the single market this is a particularly valid concern in the financial sector were banks and other financial institutions need licenses to operate in the eu member states the concern with unilateral free trade is that by respecting it it will remove any leverage the british government has to negotiate a favorable access to other actual and potential commercial partners without a treaty commercial partners it is thought will soon erect protectionist barriers 
unilateral free trade however does not mean the uk producers will be bullied without their government being able to respond first by declaring unilateral free trade the maintained strength of commercial links made will make it much easier to negotiate with the eu to antagonize a good client would be foolish lets not forget that this past decade british exports to the eu grew much slower than exports to the rest of the world at the same time the uk is a major consumer of eu products and its balance of commerce with the eu was negative by about  billion in  
but how can a country committed to unilateralism make sure other countries will not close their markets let us first remark that maintaining trade barriers to negotiate later with other nations is a selfdefeating strategy sir robert peel whom we mentioned earlier said in  that in the case of wine and brandy he did not reduce the duty because he hoped that they might employ these duties as instruments of negotiation with a view of effecting a reduction in the duties imposed by other countries on the produce of our own country such a strategy was selfdefeating tariffs in view of a negotiation by reducing the capacity of foreigners to produce for the british market were destroying the very interests that wanted free trade peel finally admitted in  during a debate in the house of commons i am bound to say that it is our interest to buy cheap whether other countries will buy cheap or no 
there certainly is a more efficient policy than maintaining trade barriers or threatening to raise some in order to force trade partners to keep their markets open indeed the british government can make it clear that if the eu unfairly penalizes british interests in some sectors eg finance then the british government will work to maintain the competitiveness of the industry in question by aggressively lowering their taxes imagine that the eu wants to damage britains car manufacturers then the british government should not be afraid to create a loophole and to lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even to zero in an economy which was never as globalized and competitive as today the uk would have good chances of prevailing over the eu interests 
perhaps the eu will consider making trading conditions with the uk harder but they would have way too much to lose if doing so means creating a fiscally ultraattractive market just next door in the short run unilateralism in trade can achieve what multilateralism cannot a quick and radical liberalization of exchanges in the long run unilateralism can achieve what multilateralism cannot genuine free trade",0
"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

"a resolution on jerusalem that will fuel antijewish incitement and violence october   joseph puder 
if anyone doubted the fact that the united nations agencies harbored a deepseated antiisrael and antijewish animus the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco vote on jerusalem proved it the unesco world heritage committee voted this week october   on a resolution dealing with jerusalem drafted by the palestinian and jordanian delegations and submitted by kuwait lebanon and tunisia all arab muslim states the executive committee of unesco approved  for  opposed  abstained and  missing the resolution that was already voted on earlier this month in which  memberstates approved the resolution algeria bangladesh brazil cuba chad dominican republic egypt iran lebanon malaysia morocco mauritius mexico mozambique nicaragua nigeria oman pakistan qatar russia senegal south africa sudan and vietnam  opposed estonia germany lithuania the netherlands uk and the us among the abstaining  states were argentina france greece india japan kenya south korea spain sri lanka and sweden 
the resolution deeply decries the continuous israeli aggressions against civilians including islamic religious figures and priests decries the forceful entering into the different mosques and historic buildings and into muslim holy sites by israelis including employees of the socalled israeli antiquities israel is urged to end these aggressions and abuses which inflame the tension on the ground and between faiths 
according to hillel neuer executive director of un watch a genevabased watchdog organization the resolution which is likely to be adopted dangerously risks fueling antijewish incitement and violence and legitimizing the escalating palestinian denial of jewish and cultural rights neuer added that this inflammatory narrative praised last week by hamas rewards the past years relentless palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks in jerusalem and other parts of israel which we mustnt forget began with false claims that israel was planning to damage the holy muslim shrines 
the expected resolution mentions eleven times alharam alsharif the muslim designation to what jews call har habayit the holiest shrine in judaism where the temple of solomon stood and also known as temple mount with the islamic bloc controlling the largest voting bloc in the un it is no wonder that a resolution of this kind can be approved oic organization of islamic cooperation being the largest and most influential bloc at the un it might as well declare that the earth is flat and it will garner a majority vote at the general assembly or its other un constituent agencies what this resolution effectively does to jerusalem is to islamize sites historically belonging to other faiths 
the latest draft does not describe the western wall as the most hallowed remains of the jewish holy temple destroyed by the romans in ce but as the western wall of al aqsa mosque in a blatant effort to erase the jewish heritage and biblical truth and as part of a campaign to islamize the site it shamelessly disregards the fact that jewish worshippers have prayed at the wall for over two thousand years the language of the draft resolution continues the deliberate attempt by the palestinian authority pa to deny the jewish historical connection to the land of israel in general and to jerusalem in particular mahmoud abbas has continued on the path of denial that arafat initiated at camp david 
among the charges brought up by the pa and the other arabmuslim states for undertaking the resolution is that the jerusalem light rail which is used daily by thousands of arab residents of jerusalem is having a damaging effect on the visual integrity and the authentic character of the walls of the old city of jerusalem yet the rail tracks pass through an existing highway and facilitates effective transportation for visitors of all faiths 
preceding the shameless resolution and the vote that took place in the paris headquarters of unesco israels president reuven rivlin stated at an event in his jerusalem residence no forum or body in the world can come and deny the connection between the jewish people the land of israel and jerusalem  and any such body that does so simply embarrasses itself we can understand criticism but you cannot change history 
unescos director general irina bokova and the chairman of unescos executive board michael worbs expressed displeasure and apologized for the resolution in an interview with israeli tv channel  on october   the day following the vote worbs said he hoped that the boards tuesday meeting will be delayed in order to reach consensus on the resolution before a formal vote bokova on her part expressed her dismay at the resolution saying that efforts to deny history and the citys jerusalem complex multifaith character harms unesco 
earlier in july  bokova stated that the heritage of jerusalem is indivisible and each of its communities have a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city to deny or conceal any of the jewish christian or muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site and runs counter to the reasons that justified its inscription in  as a world heritage site 
unesco can be counted as one of the most antiisrael un agencies in the course of a typical year the organizations legislative bodies will condemn israel  or more times with no criticism aimed at any other country in the world in  for example unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions  eight at the  st and  nd sessions of the executive board and two at the  th session of the general conference again in  unesco adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board in  unesco again adopted  antiisrael decisions at the  th and  th sessions of the executive board and two resolutions against israel at the  th session of the general conference 
whereas jerusalem was king davids capital and continued to be the capital of the second jewish commonwealth as well as israels capital today it was never the capital of any arab or muslim empire caliphate or entity nor was jerusalem a spiritual center that muslims yearned for the umayyad caliphate had its capital in damascus the abbasside caliphate capital was baghdad and the ottoman empires caliphate capital was constantinople ramle a small town in israel was its administrative capital in palestine  not jerusalem a palestinian state never existed as an independent entity and the pa claims on jerusalem are strictly contrarian  to deny jerusalem as the heart of jewish spirituality and yearning jerusalem exists in every jewish prayer and is invoked on every occasion and holiday 
dore gold former director general of israels foreign ministry addressed last years unescos jerusalem resolution he pointed out that the resolution glossed over any jewish connection to jerusalem and it failed to acknowledge christianitys ties to jerusalem 
most dismaying is the fact that christian nations who voted for the resolution or abstained have abandoned all vestiges of pride and honor and are willing to deny historical truth for narrow political interests brazil mexico and the dominican republic predominantly catholic states are a case in point unfortunately other christian countries including france spain greece argentina and sweden who should know about jerusalem from their church bibles did not have the courage to reject this outrageously false resolution it can only lead to the conclusion that perhaps cowardice and latent antisemitism drove their decision to accept not reject this infamous resolution",1
"politics us senator bernie sanders 
former us democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has threatened presidentelect donald trump warning that his camp will be trumps worst nightmare if he goes after minorities in america 
if donald trump takes peoples anger and turns it against muslims hispanics african americans and women we will be his worst nightmare the vermont senator wrote on his twitter page on thursday 
the yearold senator had earlier issued a statement after the new york businessmans victory in the us election on november  promising to work with him on certain issues but also to oppose him should he pursue divisive and discriminatory policies 
to the degree that mr trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country i and other progressives are prepared to work with him sanders said 
to the degree that he pursues racist sexist xenophobic and antienvironment policies we will vigorously oppose him he added 
during the primaries sanders ran a close race with clinton and promised to continue the fight all the way until the democratic national convention in june where the partys nominee was going to be named 
towards the end of the race however sanders changed his tone and bowed out in favor of clinton he also appeared next to her during the dnc and supported his party opponent in the democratic campaigns 
on july   sanders formally endorsed clinton after facing mounting pressure from major democratic figures including outgoing us president barack obama himself us republican presidentelect donald trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the new york hilton midtown in the early morning hours of november   in new york city photo by afp 
on tuesday trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored clinton in the presidential election sending the united states on a new uncertain path 
trump rode a wave of anger toward the elite us establishment to win the white house race against clinton a longtime washington insider 
the new york businessman garnered  electoral votes in the  us election while his rival and the former secretary of state received  votes despite winning the popular vote 
thousands of people since then have rallied in cities across the us to protest against trumps presidential election victory condemning his controversial campaign rhetoric against muslims immigrants women and other groups 
this is while trump said in his victory speech he would be president for all americans it is time for us to come together as one united people he said 
the real estate moguls election campaign had been marred by his disparaging remarks against minorities in the us his comments include a call to ban all muslims from coming to america as well as stopping mexican migrants by building a long wall along the usmexico border 
he has also sought for a database to track muslims across the united states and said that the us would have absolutely no choice but to close down mosques 
trumps proposal was widely condemned by muslim and human rights groups as well as his democratic rivals and many of his republican proponents who describe the proposal as divisive counterproductive and contrary to american values loading",1

"bloomberg reported  
to compensate for this trumps campaign has devised another strategy which not surprisingly is negative instead of expanding the electorate bannon and his team are trying to shrink it we have three major voter suppression operations under way says a senior official theyre aimed at three groups clinton needs to win overwhelmingly idealistic white liberals young women and african americans trumps invocation at the debate of clintons wikileaks emails and support for the transpacific partnership was designed to turn off sanders supporters the parade of women who say they were sexually assaulted by bill clinton and harassed or threatened by hillary is meant to undermine her appeal to young women and her  suggestion that some african american males are super predators is the basis of a belowtheradar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the pollsparticularly in florida 
the effort was obvious and according to the polling it is failing 
voter turnout among young women is expected to rise according to the latest harvard iop young voters poll sanders started flocking towards clinton in august  and havent left and early voting statistics show that africanamerican turnout is solid in swing states 
the trump campaign has realized that they dont have enough supporters to win so they are adopting tactics that run contrary to the heart of democracy to shrink the electorate in critical states 
however for voter suppression efforts like trumps to be effective the campaign must have a credible messenger donald trump is not a credible messenger to any of the voters that he is trying to deter and he has no effective surrogates that are capable of delivering his message 
a voter suppression effort was expected from the trump campaign what is unexpected is that the campaign would publicly brag about it 
people on all sides of the political spectrum who care about basic democratic institutions should be alarmed by trumps public attack on democracy 
the good news for all americans is that democrats are already fighting back  and the trump campaigns dark efforts to steal an election appear to be failing",0
"more the file photo shows former rebel renamo fighters in gorongosa mozambique photo by afp 
secret peace negotiations between mozambiques opposition leader afonso dhlakama and eu mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the countrys army and former rebel fighters local media say 
the meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in may to find a solution to the conflict between the government and dhlakamas rebel group turned political party renamo 
we had agreed with president filipe nyusi that two mediators would come  to meet me the independent weekly canal de mocambique quoted dhlakama as saying 
dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting 
there was a violent shootout i even heard explosions from here said dhlakama who has been in hiding in the central gorongosa mountains since october  
so i called chief mediator mario raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me he added 
dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was convinced that the ruling frelimo party wanted to capture me during the meeting 
it is obvious they have a plan to kill me he added 
raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an eu diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that two mediators had gone to gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader 
the diplomat said dhlakama had told the mediators to turn back at the very last moment 
the political situation in mozambique has been tense for months with dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the  elections where the frelimo party was declared the winner the party has been in power since the southern african countrys independence from portugal in  dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country 
renamo and the frelimoled government had been engaged in a civil war for  years that was brought to an end in  
renamos armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power 
on october  the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on october

au vu de la dimension mondiale des problèmes et menaces actuels et de la nécessité délaborer des stratégies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopération entre lonu et les organisations régionales et sousrégionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité
pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractère universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activités ainsi que de sa légitimité mondialement reconnue les organisations régionales quant à elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les régions relevant de leur compétence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotées de mécanismes de prévention et de maintien de la paix adaptés aux réalités locales il importe à cet égard que les activités des organisations régionales tendent à trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits émergents
dans ce contexte il est particulièrement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires régionaux se coordonnent régulièrement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales ainsi le conseil de sécurité tient régulièrement des séances sur la coopération avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en europe et lunion européenne ces dernières années un examen a également été mené sur la coopération avec la ligue des états arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamérique du sud et dautres organisations régionales
comme on le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires régionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activités de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifération des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes légères et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illégale domaines dans lesquels la coopération entre les organisations concernées et lonu est de plus en plus étroite cette coopération joue un rôle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilité à léchelle de leurasie et plus particulièrement en asie centrale
cest précisément dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone sétendant de leurope orientale à lextrêmeorient à savoir lorganisation du traité de sécurité collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la communauté détats indépendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scène politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considérablement au renforcement de la sécurité régionale et internationale
le débat sera axé sur le rôle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui pèsent sur la paix et la sécurité dans la région notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalité organisée il permettra également à ces organisations de réaffirmer leur volonté de renforcer la coopération sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre régional pour la diplomatie préventive en asie centrale
lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle à même de réagir résolument aux divers problèmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses états membres à cet égard le resserrement de la coopération entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc déploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacités de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi être mises à la disposition des opérations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menées sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan après le conflit et pour écarter la menace que représentent les stupéfiants provenant de ce pays
ses relations avec lonu se révèlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalité organisée lotsc entretient et développe des rapports productifs avec les entités spécialisées de lonu notamment le comité contre le terrorisme du conseil de sécurité et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime
tous les deux ans lassemblée générale adopte une résolution sur la coopération entre lonu et lotsc et il est prévu quelle en adopte une à sa soixante et onzième session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitulé  coopération entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations régionales ou autres 
les fondements juridiques de la coopération entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont été posés à la suite de la signature en  de la déclaration conjointe sur la coopération entre les secrétariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent étroitement dans des domaines tels que la prévention et le règlement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance régionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre à cette fin la nonprolifération des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalité transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la sécurité informatique internationale
dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts déployés par la communauté internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rétablir la paix en afghanistan se prononçant toujours en faveur du maintien du rôle central de coordination de lonu dans le règlement du conflit afghan
quant à la cei la sécurité et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours été et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopération entre ses états membres
une coopération constructive avec les organisations internationales est également essentielle pour contrer les menaces émergentes les pays de la cei sont parties à tous les principaux instruments internationaux régissant la coopération dans les domaines de la sécurité du désarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement à leur mise en uvre
des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rôle moteur de lonu et de la nécessité détablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entités spécialisées comme le comité contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les réfugiés et le groupe daction financière sur le blanchiment des capitaux
lélargissement et le renforcement de la coopération entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopération et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de manière constructive à la réalisation des objectifs de lonu y compris à lélimination des menaces et problèmes actuels dune part ces organisations régionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacités au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopération avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prérogatives et de celles de son conseil de sécurité
dans ce contexte nous invitons les états membres de lonu à exposer leurs idées sur les moyens de renforcer la sécurité dans la région eurasienne avec laide des mécanismes régionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilité de cette vaste région est une condition sine qua non de la croissance économique et de lédification de létat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par conséquent reconnaissants aux délégations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre sécurité et développement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune légitimité universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratégies novatrices visant la stabilisation des régions vulnérables susceptibles par la suite dêtre mises en uvre dans dautres régions du monde qui sont au centre des préoccupations du conseil de sécurité

"in a stunning turn of events  days before the  presidential election the fbi announced it is reopenning its investigation into hillary clintons email server case by probing newly emerging emails linked to hillary clinton 
new probe the fbi gives hillary clinton a second look photo illustraion wire 
fbi october surprise 
according to reports  in a letter written today fbi director james comey  stated that the fbi has begun a new probe into hillary clinton related emails once again comey offered scant details about the new probe but due to an unrelated case additional classified material may have been mishandled on clintons personal email server 
cnbc reported the latest fbi developments including a passage from comeys letter discussing the new investigation 
in previous congressional testimony i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation fbi had completed its investigation of former secretary clintons personal email server due to recent developments i am writing to supplement my previous testimony comey wrote 
in connection with an unrelated case the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday and i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation he added 
although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony comey concluded 
humas estranged sexting husband 
according to a new report released via the new york times  
the presidential campaign was rocked on friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the nowclosed investigation into hillary clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to anthony d weiner the estranged husband of a top clinton aide  in a letter to congress  the fbi director james b comey said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case which law enforcement officials said was an fbi investigation into illicit text messages from mr weiner to a yearold girl in north carolina mr weiner a former democratic congressman from new york is married to huma abedin the top aide comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting clinton off the hook for mishandling and lying to congress about classified emails coming through her home brew email server while she was secretary of state after previously closing the case comey has done a uturn and is now saying the fbi will review the new emails to for classified information and see whether it was mishandled 
this unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a wikileaks docudump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between clinton foundation donors and former president bill clinton s private financial activities among those included in the memo was a  million dollar business arrangement under bill clinton inc with another  million dollar deal scheduled over nine years 
the following is a tweet from brad jaffy of nbc nightly news containing the new fbi recommendation 
the new investigation into the clinton camp will most certainly spark new paytoplay allegations  as the new fbi revelations also comes days after a project veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners discussed ways to commit largescale voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at donald trump rallies out of creamers  visits to the white house also included his wife a term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky some  times white house visitor records show that schakowsky took  private meetings with obama or his senior staff also over the past year the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain highranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability caught on film  robert creamer resigns over a massive democratic party controversy image source cnn  creamer a convicted felon  in  creamer plead guilty  million in bank fraud and tax violations was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaigns inner circle following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at trump rallies pay to play virginia governor terry mcauliffe closely allied with the clintons negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the fbi image source new republic  it remains unclear what exactly reopened the new clinton probe but perhaps the fbi had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime clinton associate  virginia gov terry mcauliffe  helped steer  to the election campaign of the wife of an fbi official who went on to lead the probe into hillary clintons use of a private email system according to a report the ny post also reported on the matter this past week 
the political action committee of mcauliffe the clinton loyalist gave  to the state senate campaign of the wife of andrew mccabe who is now deputy director of the fbi according to the wall street journal  
the report states jill mccabe received an additional  from the virginia democratic party which is heavily influenced by mcauliffe 
the money directed by mcauliffe began flowing two months after the fbi investigation into clinton began in july  around that time the candidates husband was promoted from running the washington field office for the fbi to the no  position at the bureau 
in a cnn report from october th a week before the mcauliffe revelations according to notes from interviews conducted during an fbi investigation into clintons email practices undersecretary of state patrick kennedy personally tried to convince fbi officials that the email should be declassified one interviewee described feeling pressured by another fbi official at kennedys request 
the newly reopened fbi investigation into clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above but theres no doubt that due to public backlash the fbi received following the first clinton investigation in addition to concerns over dealings between the fbi and clinton associates  the agency needed to save face 
it remains to be seen how new case will impact the us presidential election

"while richard spencers halfjoke of hailing donald trump with r oman salute rose a lot of dust some remarks in his npi speech point into rather sinister direction a posthuman one 
transcript with references and additional av material 
undoubtedly there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when hillary clinton lost presidential elections to donald trump if for nothing else then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears because racism homophobia xenophobia and whateverphobia it was a joy and a relief because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism  dubbed political correctness to be a paper tiger 
however party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance as sjw s are hopefully moving out from the spotlight of posthistorical stage the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image if we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn this image will be just as ugly  and just as unreal  as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct  shitlib  
in the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the alternative right movement richard spencer in the future we are to deal with the leadership of children of the sun 
this is an interesting and to my mind quite worrisome statement of intent  a manifestation of will as spencer would doubtless rectify me  pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal  and quite unidirectional  circular movement of the pagan deity revered by all selfrespecting übermenschen  from nietzsche to postmodern occultists 
however theres a deeper astrotheological metaphor at work here the pure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy nietzsche in its virtual postmodern installment is not to be strictly represented by swastika  as spencer apparently assumes but by other only seemingly ancient symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and pc gaming and turned into ideological brand by russian philosopher alexander dugin or his minions an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement 
the symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement not of sun but of presumably primordial origin of everything chaos 
in the lines to follow well provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation the channeling of chaos principle  and adjacent chaos logic  through loosely knit alt right movement taking as a starting point some statements from spencers speech held at npi conference in washington dc on november  st  

triumph of the will or hipster babylon working 

in introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right embodied in the election of donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though we always took trump seriously there was still a moment of unreality  or perhaps too painfully intense reality  when the state of pennsylvania was called for donald trump the moment when we knew kek had smiled upon us that meme magic was real and though these terms are used halfjokingly they represent something truly importantthe victory of will  we willed donald trump into office made this dream into reality  
it is all delivered in a manner of an injoke not to be taken too seriously moreover to the uninitiated into mysteries of this internet movement it is probably unclear who is kek and what exactly is meme magic 
well start our explanation with lesser weirdness 
meme is an expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently by richard dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology memes are thoughts expressed in image andor phrase which by circulation in public acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to infect the consciousness with their messages like viruses meme is inexistent because theres no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based selfsubsistence and ability to procreate like viruses images andor phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial yet they quite paradoxically exist because analogy apparently works  however no one seems to pose the question why it works 
well it works because it is magical 

chaos magick 

here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern  in fact posthumanist  vein resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can  and should  be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution if artificial construct is in line with principle of evolution it is real or to be more precise it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle it is imagined into existence  
therefore meme magick works only insofar it relies upon artificial preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with memes as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs 
the goal of practitioner of such magic  a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic  is to change the world according to his will this is more or less what is known from the seventies of the last century as chaos magick  a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in subhuman and subnatural domain of the world in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it the peculiarity of chaos magick is on the one hand that it is entirely syncretic ie that it uses everything that its practitioner can imbibe with intended subjective meaning and that it relies on virtual ie artificial world of mass culture now embodied above all in internet 
the idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible  
there are many interesting implications to this 
the first is that everything is interrelated ie that everything is connected with everything else so any which way you take youll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough the second is that theres no hierarchy of higher and lower  theres only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements dissolving in turn into nothingness if concentrated upon as theres nothing higher theres nothing to be revered and everything can  and indeed should  be an object of ironical laughter and most importantly this is the world of dreams ruled by what is usually called dream logic but in actual fact chaos logic or unlogic  
in this sense richard spencer quite accurately proclaimed trumps victory an accomplishment of meme or chaos magick 
trump is willed into office by internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality  virtual reality one may add yet reality nonetheless the fact that trump was elected for a plethora of motives  from the appeal of his politics to public takedown of hillary clinton by wikileaks  is immaterial because in the world of chaos every subjective reality tunnel or interpretation of the world is as real as any other 
in this sense we can observe new god emperor of usa as a magical creation of internet by the internet and for the internet  today still the internet of interconnected computer nodes but soon probably the internet of things if one is to push spencers remark to its logical extreme we can assert that illustrious donald is the worlds first president of posthuman race an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra antiprogressive group 
so that was lesser weirdness let us proceed now to high weirdness 


we owe the reader an answer to a question who the hell is kek 
well the reason why spencer mentions him is again a magickal halfjoke kek is interpreted to be an ancient egyptian deity by a number of internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar  pepe the frog while i habitually suspend judgment on all things egyptian because ancient egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts i consider this interpretation upon closer inspection to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic 
namely pepe the cartoon character conceived in  by cartoonist matt furie emerged as a meme from the depths of internet forums more precisely chan subforum pol devoted to political discussions with no holds barred which was in view of some observers a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados a place of absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the injoke among the players of world of warcraft  replacing the standard internet abbreviation lol laughing out loud someone eventually noticed that kek is in fact the name of frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos and darkness and pepe was rebranded as kek the deity  ironic one no doubt half joking one as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it but deity nonetheless 
it is important to point out that in view of the most esoteric kekists that is half grinning faithful of kekpepe the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events so it came to pass that kek sounds very similar to cuckoriginally cuckservative a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not red pilled another meme taken from pop culture shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists by alt right or should we assume kek himself furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe as nothing less than public enemy identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character then it happened that after this act hillary fainted in front of the cameras and that was immediately interpreted as an action of kek 
a good rundown of kekpepetrump identification 
however it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on pol subforum 
one last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture dubs 
every post on chan and similar venues comes with an digit numerical stamp this number represents that posts entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard 
with the amount of traffic these sites get the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll when a poster gets repeated digits its called dubs trips quads and so on 
since a poster cant know their post number until after theyve submitted the post its common for people to bet the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits  when that endeavor proves a successful a get has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated 
out of this practice a strange phenomenon began to take place on pol discussion threads associated with trump displayed noticeably frequent gets it wasnt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture pepe the frog now pols unofficial mascot donald trump pols overwhelming candidate of choice repeating digit post numbers gets kek used as an expression of delight particular in response to trumps trolling of the establishment as well as in reaction to unlikely gets in general 
and a god was born  source  

synchronicities related to emergence of kek the god and his merging with trump in the bowels of internet forums early on in the presidential campaign are so numerous and frankly mind boggling that we cannot list them here for the sake of brevity for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados including core leadership kek is the god and trump is his prophet all declared with smug grin and ironical stance yet with all the necessary power of conviction 
namely chaos magick relies on laughter or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially unprincipled fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its practitioner to impose his own will and change the world  as spencer would put it make his dreams a reality 
i would go further and add make all reality a dream  because chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual ie posthuman  world the idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism  in its essence however it is a complete opposite a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles  above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of being  into nothingness of primordial chaos 

posthuman traditionalism 

i already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of alexander dugin who is probably the most consequent subverter of tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age but now we can see how his affiliates in usa and europe are doing the same thing  with less philosophical subtlety but fueled by much greater raw power namely alt right if we are to judge by what its leadership advocates is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition  something richard spencer likes to call political theology  founded on new age filtered aryan myths  racial interpretation of nietzsche and generally crossbred with do your own thing mentality all done in the virtual ether of information technology after all if we are to agree with spencer  half jokingly of course  that god emperor was inaugurated by the act of kek the god then the victory of alt right traditionalists is in fact the victory of technological magic the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand ray kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics  
in the end therefore we are talking about another victory of posthumanism branded spontaneously or otherwise as traditionalism the obsession of alt right adherents with identity in general and white identity in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of tradition they supposedly defend they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted  observing the plethora of various rather eccentric individuals in its vanguard from macho gay postmodern spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic  and to a large extent made up  pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator save maybe for quite unchallenged neodarwinist stance especially to be found among game bloggers as chateau heartiste  if someone thinks that he can reattach himself to premodern spiritual history of humankind  actually the only one there is  while at the same time musing about alpha and beta males sexual market signaling and countersignaling professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental gmo of memes genes and biological analogies he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends 
the allure of alt right lies in its dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the west induced by process of globalization yet this is an eristic or to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine discordian dialectic the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of chaos it is all done with the crooked half grin a pinch of salt to every smug remark  with irony of the man who knows hes a liar and a cheat but smug humor goes just a short way in the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend far more effectively than dead serious pc brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for 
well end with the word of warning to christian adherents of alt right the words have a definite meanings and power theres only one chaos and theres only one bringer of light from chaos  as some kek worshipers already defined the poor frogs main job  and its not the one to be defined as god from god light from light but god from gutter light from darkness a real darkness shining in virtual brightness hope you guess his name 
so without a pinch of irony i declare be careful who your hail

"carter reveals upgrades to us long range rocket

after the panel he continued we thought it was important to come out in public with atacms for the army because theres been a lot of writing a lot of speeches on the need for the army to go crossdomain high ranking officials in the us military have been calling for the atacms to extend its capabilities seaward for some time and roper responded to these concerns saying its time for us to show it isnt just a theoretical idea its something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have

"interviews james clapper director of us national intelligence agency speaks at the council of foreign relations in new york city on october   afp photo 
james clapper the us director of national intelligence has warned that the establishment of a nofly zone in syria could prompt russia to shoot down us planes this comes as hillary clinton the democratic nominee for the  us presidential election has called for establishing a nofly zone in the arab country russia has recently deployed mobile s and s missile batteries to western syria which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft 
gordon duff a senior editor with the veterans today told press tv that james clapper who spoke out against former secretary of states emphasis on a nofly zone over syria is responsible because the american officials obtain their intelligence on the syrian conflict from the spy chief 
the public position of the united states visàvis syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by james clapper duff noted adding he clapper is the one that talks about the gas hes the one who talks about the barrel bombs and everything thats been disproven 
he said every crazy scheme that the us comes up with to blame syria for killing its own people or the russians for slaughtering people in hospitals it all comes from james clapper the director of the national intelligence agency who fed that information to secretary clinton who fed that information to president barack obama 
clinton said that she favored a nofly zone only if acceptable for both russia and damascus and after negotiations which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes duff said 
duff added that the imposition of nofly zone obviously is going to help no one but alnusra front and isis daesh terrorists 
damascus and moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the arab country but the us and its allies push for imposing a nofly zone on syria to pursue their agenda in the warridden state 
since march  syria has been gripped with foreignbacked militancy which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead or wounded and millions of others homeless loading",1
"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

"email 
former secretary of state hillary clinton arranged a  million donation from moroccan king mohammed vi to her familys charity in  in return for the clinton global initiative hosting its international meeting in the north african muslim nation according to an email made public thursday by wikileaks 
the moroccan monarchs funds went to the clinton foundations endowment and to cgi the jan   email was included in wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from clintons presidential campaign chairman john podesta 
the email from huma abedin clintons deputy chief of staff at the state department was addressed to podesta and campaign manager robby mook hillary clinton was a director of the foundation at the time 
singapore and hong kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the cgi meeting in their countries but the north african nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in marrakesh morocco in  abedin told podesta and mook that morocco was not cgis first choice 
the actual meeting was paid for by ocp the moroccangovernmentowned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations clinton vigorously supported the moroccan king when she was secretary of state and the usfinanced exportimport bank gave ocp a  million loan guarantee during her tenure as secretary of state 
the mining company also contributed between  million to  million to the clinton foundation according to the charitys web siteabedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss hillary clinton created this mess and she knows it she told podesta and mookshe said the moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss this was hrcs idea our office approached the moroccans and they  percent believe they are doing this at her request the king has personally committed approx  million both for the endowment and to support the meeting hrc stands for hillary rodham clinton 
abedin said clintons attendance at the cgi event was a condition of the  million contribution just to give you some context the condition upon which the moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation if hrc was not part if it meeting was a nonstarter abedin said 
politico in  reported that clinton was seen by rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the obama administration rabat is the capital of morocco 
the robert f kennedy center for justice charged ocp with serious human rights violations including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there 
mohamed yeslem beisat the washington envoy for the polisaro front as reported by almonitor a middle east news site in  that ocp is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past  years 
polisaro claims to lead a moroccan governmentinexile based in tindouf algeria 
theyre doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara beisat charged 
the moroccan firm mines phosphates human rights critics have called ocps mining product blood phosphates appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
ocp is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the clinton foundation the foundation accepted a  million pledge from lukas lundin who owns mining and oil drilling operations in north africa and in the congo related clinton foundation got m from blood minerals firm 
ocp retained the law firm of covington  burling one of washingtons lobbying giants paying the firm  million in fees from  to  
stuart eizenstat a former white house domestic policy chief under president carter and an influential democratic party insider was the main lobbyist for the mining firm he was also president bill clintons ambassador to the european union a deputy secretary of the treasury and under secretary at the department of commerce 
eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at commerce where he worked in the international trade administration 
hillary clinton officially visited morocco twice in november  and in february  meeting with the king on both occasions the two also met in new york in december  where it was believed the two discussed moroccos bid to host the cgi meeting and the kings  million donation 
the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family as well as hillary clintons esteem for morocco and its people 
abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement it would hurt clintons relationship with the king it will break a lot of china to back out now she wrote 
ultimately clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign but the former president and daughter chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the moroccan kings palaces",0

halls suspension reminds me of the famous cases of two american academics steven salaita and norman finkelstein both were openly critical of zionism and spoke against the marginalization and persecution of the indigenous arab populations of the occupied territories both were ostracized publicly for their vocal support of palestinian rights and lost their jobs
i adjure the not to take a page out of the american playbook by punishing academics who dare to speak up for the marginalized peoples of the world please live up to the values of the wiser more ethical and socially conscientious northern neighbour you have always represented for americans like myself

but turnout is a concern the exceptionally negative tone of this years race for the white house has soured young americans on politics reutersipsos polling shows 
presidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals said tevi troy who chronicled the strategy in his book what jefferson read ike watched and obama tweeted  years of pop culture in the white house 
campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture said troy a presidential historian who worked in the george w bush white house 
the events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign a way to show a groundswell of support behind a candidate  and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians said kasper who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics

political activist and hillary supporter amal clooney traveled to texas to warn americans about our elected president donald j trump and his tough immigration policies maybe she didnt get the memotrumps tough immigration stance is what catapulted him to the top of the heap in the crowded pack of gop primary contenders it wasnt too long ago that her arrogant liberal husband announced with great confidence there will never be a president trump 
perhaps amal shouldve traveled to some of the border towns if she wanted to get a clear picture of how illegal immigration is affecting our nation aliens crossing our borders illegally have destroyed the property of american ranchers and threatened the safety and security of american citizens living in homes in or near the us mexican border towns 
amal clooney has warned that many of presidentelect trumps proposals would be violations of international law 
speaking at the texas conference for women at the austin convention center on tuesday the international human rights lawyer and wife of george clooney said she had concerns about americas reputation under the real estate moguls plans 
she noted that trumps comments during his campaign that there should be a religious test imposed on entering the us or the fact that there should be statesponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed  all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that 
the yearold wife said americas reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk 
i think theres some concern from abroad as to are these things actually going to happen or is the us going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally according to the hollywood reporter 
perhaps its time to put our nations security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us 
both amal and her hollywood actor husband george a staunch hillary clinton supporter have spoken out against trump in the past 
earlier this year amal clooney called for trump to be challenged on his extreme views 
watch george clooney here whine about press giving trump too much favorable press 
when you listen to what the leading candidate on the republican side has been saying about building walls about excluding mexicans and a complete shutdown of all muslims entering in and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about muslims he kept saying they only want jihad they dont believe in our way of life they dont respect our system clooney said via daily mail",1
"october has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign in the beginning of the month women came forward accusing trump of unwelcome advances later fbi director james comey reopened the criminal investigation of hillary clinton after finding more government emails on pervert anthony weiners computer but the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective service
the meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the draftourdaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the hillary campaign first hillary is a radical feminist thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat as a step in that direction hillary told the huffington post that she will support legislation to register for the draft
young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal they should reconsider because of the second policy of the clinton campaign she will almost certainly start a war against russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines
hillary has repeatedly blamed russia for wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military action
as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses 
the draftourdaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the hillary campaign to get elected hillary relies on two demographics people of color and liberal white women up until now women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively if they become aware that hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with russia they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist position
here are some of the best examples of the draftourdaughters campaign

i feel this one is the most powerful it clearly states hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with russia unlike the arab nations that the us has been toppling for the neocons russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons any military conflict will not be short and easy that means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect hillary



the above three ads all target the weak cowardly men who either support hillary or the never trump cuckservatives in the alt right these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives hence they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own my wifes son or my wifes daughter
the ad below drives this point home even more forcefully while women might encourage their men to vote hillary or oppose trump for being too alpha they secretly despise the weakness of these men

the following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your louboutins for combat boots


 


lots of the ads emphasize hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward putin and russia she has blamed wikileaks on russian hacking even though there is no proof that the russians were to blame and she and the obama administration have been saber rattling against russia in syria
the really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the us must go to war with russia all the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like hillary


the ad below indicates that our enemy putin has a saner view on women in combat than the democrats do

while the campaign is mostly geared to point out hillarys intention to draft women it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that hillary will start

the media often portrays war as a sanitized affair a soldier safely positioned in a uslocated command center controls a drone that takes out the bad guys the reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed once hillary gets in it wont be just men dying in large numbers women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out


a final ad drives home the point that the future war with russia and iran and syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil it will be for hillarys power trip 
conclusion elections matter for decades women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people if they are successful in electing hillary they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions but unfortunately they will not be the only people impacted thousands of innocent americans russians syrians and iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling
the draftourdaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly

"a gateway between western and eastern europe lies on the charles river in the czech republicprague its been a western tourist hotspot for many years now many people consider it a city overrun by the westerners ruined and no longer worth it
ive spent the last month of my travels here in prague and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east ukraine 
with that being said here are  observations ive made about prague
 yes its overrun but 
that doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun yes if you choose to stay in prague zone  youre going to have a drastically different experience there will be hoards of people with selfie sticks and fat western girls wobbling all over old town blocking the already narrow streets
if you head out to prague    etc youll have a much different experience youll get to meet some locals try beer other than staropramen and avoid the throngs of tourists
of course its important to note that prague is a beautiful city its natural to want to see some of the sights if you choose to go this route theres simply no way around it
 the reaction from locals changes over time 
simply put locals are used to westerners and most of them roll their eyes at them however once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots theyre far more friendly
just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete  on me in the few weeks ive been here it went from a general coldness that they show all english speakers to genuine warmth
 the beauty of the city is unreal 
this is my third time in prague and im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is from the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings its just a very pleasant place to be there are a lot of beautiful cities in europe but prague is definitely near the top of all of them
you cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it
 cheap by western standards expensive by ee simply put if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed and theres not many ways around it prague landlords know the power of western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it
its far far cheaper to sign a lease for a   or  month period
a meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between  usd this is incredibly cheap compared to places like italy spain or london at the same time its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as kiev budapest or some cities in poland
if you want actual numbers id say its about  more expensive than kiev probably about  more expensive than budapest the last time i was there was april  so keep that in mind and just marginally more expensive than poland
of course as i keep harping on this its going to get cheaper the further you go from the old town area
 the girls 
i know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this so lets break it down the girls are hot theyre not as hot as ukrainian and russian girls but theyre a step above polish women 
at this point its easy to see that any and all local czech girls living in prague are basically immune to foreigners you arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the old town in fact shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area
however being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there in colombia girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner in ukraine theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign in prague theyll do neither especially the high quality ones 
however the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently
plus its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around just keep your liquor in check and avoid putting a gopro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game
 conclusionis it livable 
when you come from a place like ukraine prague feels much more like home the english is better and it has a more western feel you can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the former soviet union countries ukraine belarus etc
the question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over theres no denying that prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was  years ago
however prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done the internet is fast the city is interesting and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do
you could do a lot worse

automation in the workplace can bring new levels of efficiency and employee happiness but it can also mean that human workers lose their jobs in favor of robotic replacements no matter your stance on cuttingedge technology in the office there is no doubt that its a swiftly approaching reality according to a new study released by stanford university americans can expect over  percent of all workplace discrimination to be fully automated by  
the future is coming and its coming fast 
thanks to recent advancements in computer intelligence and predictive analytics it may not be long before you see an automated machine in your office demoting female employees for becoming pregnant whether humiliating subordinates with unwanted sexual comments or automatically filtering out résumés from people with middle eastern last names trends in technological development suggest that an increasingly computerized workforce will soon be enforcing inequality in office environments with far greater proficiency and costeffectiveness than human labor 
people think that automated workplace discrimination is still far off in the future when truthfully its right around the corner said stanford computer scientist dr oliver thorpe who spearheaded the new study were already at the point with facial recognition software where it can identify which genders and races should be passed up for leadership roles with far greater accuracy than humans and technologies like this are only getting better and cheaper by the day 
with intelligent algorithms becoming rapidly more sophisticated and capable virtually every industry can soon expect to begin replacing humans with machines that can oppress minorities senior citizens and other subjugated people groups with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy within  years marketavailable computers will have the ability to grossly neglect the needs of disabled workers and make them feel like burdens within  years roving automatons will travel about openplan offices smacking female subordinates buttocks with their carbonfiber paddle attachments adeptly wielding their power in such a way as to avoid consequences 
some believe that machines will never be able to fully replicate the complexity and intuitiveness of human onthejob prejudice but employers will likely be willing to sacrifice that human touch for the sake of their bottom line thorpe notes that maintaining a fuckedup culture of occupational disparity is expensive and as soon as companies realize that they can enlist semiautonomous robots to mistreat their employees at a fraction of the cost theyll be lining up to install them in offices nationwide 
only time will tell whether or not the human workers who have so dutifully carried out discriminatory business practices for decades get laid off or reassigned but one thing is for sure the american office is about to look way different",0

the revelation led house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul to describe clintons handling of her email system during her tenure as secretary of state as treason 
she exposed information to our enemies mccaul said on fox  friends thursday morning our adversaries have this very sensitive information  in my opinion quite frankly its treason 
mccaul rtexas said that fbi director james comey told him previously that foreign adversaries likely had gotten into her server when comey publicly discussed the clinton email case back in july he also said that while there was no evidence hostile actors breached the server it was possible they had gained access 
if true this is much more than possible and it would explain the level of outrage within the fbi at the pass that hillary clinton has received",1

"is too much screen time hurting your kids mental growth 
  daniel barker tags children  screen time  limits naturalnews in an effort to steer away from its previous onesizefitsall policy the american association of pediatrics aap has issued a new set of guidelines regarding how much time children should spend in front of television and computer screensuntil now the aap had recommended no more than two hours of screen time for children  regardless of their age the type of content viewed or which medium was being usedrecognizing that such a blanket approach could not effectively address the issues at hand the aap has recently taken steps to broaden its policiesfrom gizmodocomin a series of papers published today in the science journal pediatrics its clear that the aap has significantly revised its thinking on the matter breaking down media use according to all these criteria and to support parents with these new recommendations the aap has published an interactive online tool that families can use to create a personalized family media use plan aaps new screen time guidelines the new recommendations are aimed at the unique circumstances of various age groups for example the aap recommends that children under  months should avoid screens altogether except for limited occasions such as social media sessions with grandparentschildren between the ages of  and  months may be introduced to digital media but the content should be highquality programming and watched together with parentskids between the ages of  and  should be limited to one hour of highquality programming which also should be watched in the presence of parentsparents should impose consistent limits on the time spent in front of a screen by children  and older especially for entertainment purposes children should not be allowed to sleep with their smartphones tablets etc and should have one mediafree hour before bedtimemediafree times such as during meals should be established and mediafree zones in the household should be definedmaking sure kids get an hour of daily exercise and enough sleep at night is also part of the equation according to the aap parenting in the digital age aint easy as logical as these recommendations may sound implementing them may not always be easy most parents know that limiting their kids online time isnt always easy and many would be forced to admit that digital media can be a helpful tool in managing children parents obviously want to raise healthy children who arent constantly glued to computer screens but these devices are a godsend for those moments when a parent needs to make dinner or when they simply need to go to the bathroom when it comes to limiting screen time  theres a tradeoff between parental health and the needs of a childand that needs to be acknowledgedlets face it smartphones play a big part in our childrens lives now for better or for worse there is also an age when a parent can no longer police a childs online activity without invading his or her privacythe best thing a parent can do is to set consistent rules for younger childrens screen time and to try to help them learn to use the technology without becoming hopelessly addicted to itone way to accomplish that is by setting an example how much time do you spend in front of a tv computer or smartphone screen yourself in the presence of your childrenmany adults are as hopelessly addicted to digital media as their teens or children are if you expect a child to limit their time online you must be willing to do the sameyou might even try doing something completely out of the ordinary like reading a book to your child or having your child read one to youas crazy as it might sound there was a time when such practices were common  sources",0
leave a reply aa michael  when you are attuned to the midthdimensional frequencies of light you relinquish the idea of being human as you have known it in the past it is a time of the emergence of your soul consciousness as you allow it to become the reigning influence within your life this means you begin to listen to the wisdom of your body elemental and the signals it sends as to what is appropriate for your physical and emotional wellbeing your dna and the cells of your body begin to integrate the higher frequencies of light and gradually you begin to vibrate and attune to the refined energy of the new age this period of the transformation process could be likened to a death of your old selfconsciousness which is really the process of removing the veils of illusion as you integrate each new level of your oversoulhigher self you absorb the wisdom and illumination of that facet of your vaster being you are in the process of shedding the multiple layers of density which you have absorbed within your auric field down through the many ages of earthly experience the saying the light shall set you free is a true statement for the light is dissolving the layers upon layers of negativity that you have carried for such a very long time you begin to function within an auric field of refined light of your own creation as you turn inward and learn to stay focused and centered within your sacred heart in the power of the now moment over time you as light transformers begin to draw forth and integrate the maximum amount of adamantine particles of creator light and you then consciously radiate forth the remainder out to humanity and to the world when you achieve a certain level of harmony within you open the physical body gateways or portals to the higher dimensions the ascension chakra or the medulla oblongata and the vagus nerve at the base of the skull and also the back portal of your sacred heart and your sacred mind these are major steps in the ascension process when this process is complete you are well on your way to gaining access to the first sublevel of the fifth dimension where your entrylevel sacred triad is waiting to welcome you the adameve kadmon body is your original individualized seed atom godself in a fully conscious light body form created by the elohim lords of lightbuilders of as the archetype of humanity the adam kadmon embodies the original complete divine and spiritual nature of manwoman it is not the same as your personal oversoul body of light which is itself evolving towards divine consciousness your higher selves your spiritualoversoul body and your sacred triads are refracted facets of your god self your original light body the kadmon light body has the ability to take on any form necessary to create and experience all forms of creation in your fathermother gods plan for this universe the adameve kadmon is a spiritualphysical creation which incarnates in the planetary worlds during all cycles of divine creation physical body  in the beginning awakening process there is a desire to turn inward and to listen to the inner wisdom of the soul this soul awareness includes your body elemental the memory seed atom which contains the perfect blueprint for your original adameve kadmon light form emotional body  first you become aware that your emotions control you through your wants needs and desires which in the long run do not bring you a sense of happiness or satisfaction you begin to turn inward and to question your life choices asking awhat have been the results of your actions you begin to seek answers for the pain and dissatisfaction in your life the voice of your superconscious mind becomes stronger as you gradually take heed and follow your souls guidance as you become comfortable and begin to rely on this voice of higher wisdom the egodesire body gradually relinquishes control and the soulself becomes the director and guiding influence in your life you begin to align your will with the will of your higher self for you have gradually learned to trust the inspirational and intuitive thoughts from your sacred mind eventually you begin to view all interactive events in your life from a higher vantage point you develop emotional detachment through a more refined view of human interactions having experienced most of the important tests of the emotions you develop a better understanding of the human emotional nature again you learn to go with the flow and you view your tests and challenges as gifts and opportunities for growth you have learned to make peace with the past and to script your future as you endeavor to live and focus on the now moment gradually over time the vibrational patterns of the emotional body are lifted above the magnetic pull of the physical realm the mental body  you begin to realize the limitations of your subconscious and conscious minds and you see how rigid limited and stuck you have been in the mass consciousness belief structure you willingly begin a selfanalysis process whereby you reevaluate your attitudes judgment and programmed concepts you begin to feel a burning desire to expand your knowledge beyond your physical reality as you seek to learn why you are here on earth and the greater meaning of life your instinctive mind gives way to your higher intellectual mind and gradually you gain access to your sacredintuitive mind as your soulself becomes the director of your destiny your life begins to change dramatically for the better then faith and trust become an inborn certainty that all is happening in divine order you also know with certainty that you are on an upward spiraling path to a more refined harmonious and loving reality all you have to do is stay in the moment and take one

the fsb fails to collect the detonator which is photographed by the local police the following morning september  the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted they praise the vigilance of the local people and the ryazan police police comb the city and find the suspects car a telephone operator for longdistance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation the
