To run the notebook, first update the first cell of the notebook with the path to the datasets folder. (path_to_the_data_folder = '/kaggle/input/' change this to the current dataset folder.)
Then run the second cell to train it and get the report. 
Then run the thrird cell to interpret the model.
Without GPU this would take a lot of time. Probably a day or so. With GPU it would run in couple of hours.
